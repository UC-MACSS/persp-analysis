# Student submissions

All submissions for course assignments should be stored in this folder. Create a subfolder following the syntax `lastname_firstname/` in this directory (e.g. `soltoff_benjamin` or `mausolf_joshua`).

### Submitting your assignment

All assignments for this course should be submitted via [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). The basic workflow for homework should be:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [course repository](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis)
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files and [commit changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) to complete your paper/problem set.
1. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes up to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. *Make sure to include your name in the pull request.*

> Once you have forked the repository the first time, you do not need to make a new fork for each assignment. Rather, [sync your fork with the upstream repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). This will merge updates to the assignment repository with your fork.
