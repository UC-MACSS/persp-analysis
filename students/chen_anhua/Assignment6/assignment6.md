Background
----------

In 2014, an experiment on exploring whether additional information
increases voters turnout in non-partisan Montana Supreme Court Justice
general election has caused some controversy in terms of the ethics
aspects of the research design/execution. Three political scientists
affiliated with Dartmouth college and Stanford University sent mailers
to 102,780 registered voters about candidates' standing on a scale from
liberal to conservative, in order to see whether providing more
information will increase voters turnout for supreme court justice
general election. We will first conduct a general assessment of this
study under the four-principle framework of ethical research proposed by
Salganik, we then focus on discussing whether and how this experiment
study could potentially effect the election results before concluding on
what alternative design could be utilized to improve the soundness in
ethics aspect of this research.

Assessment of the experiment under Salganik's four priunciples of ethical research (Q1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Respect for persons

As stated in the Belmont Report, the autonomy of the participants is
central to the principle of respect for persons. A practical
interpretation of "autonomy" is that researchers should, if possible,
receive informaed consent from participants before the project is
actually carried out. Researchers in the Montana Flyer Project, however,
did not even try to design a informing mechanism for its participants to
ensure the voluntary nature of their participation. Instead, they just
sent out the flyers directly to mailboxes of 102,780 Montanans. Even
though some would argue that the project hasn't compromised voters'
autonomy in deciding whether to vote or whom to vote for, the autonomy
associated with whether they would be willing to receive such
information (candidates' political ideology tendency) or to participate
in this study at all have been totally neglected. The fact that the
first batch of (informal) complaints were filed by some Montanan
registered voters could be deemed as an evidence of researchers' failure
in addressing the respect for persons in their experiment design, while
the actual content of these complaints could represent the study's
failure in addressing other ethic aspects under the four-principle
framework which we will discuss later.

### Beneficence

The Beneficence dimension of the ethics of researh, in practice,
involves two major parts: The researhers should conduct a very careful
calculation of the potential cost and benefits has the project been
conducted; Then they should decide, based on the calculation of
cost-benefit analysis, whether the project should be conducted from the
morality's point of view. At first glance, the Montana Flyer Project
seems to lean more towards providing more benefits than costs to the
participants and Montanan society as a whole since the exact research
question they have in mind is whether provision of more information will
influence the turnout of voters at election.

However, a more detailed scrutiny of the study reveals that this
cost-benefit balance depends substantially on the quality of information
itself and participants' potential perception of this piece of
information. If the information provided by researchers are faulted, or
has a strong tendency to mislead its audience, the cost and risks
associated this project will be considerably larger, magnified by the
negative externality it could incurred on the Montanan society as a
whole. Based on the received complaints, the Great Seal included in the
mailer have misled participants into believing the postcard is from the
state office or for the purpose of certain political campaign even
though the footnote has mentioned the information is paid for by
researchers in Stanford and Dartmouth. Moreover, the information that
two charts in the mailer are produced based on the public information
about who had donated to each of the campaign is not stated on the
mailer, and should in no sense be the only indicator of gauging
candidates' political ideology, which cast considerable amount of doubt
on the information quality provided in the mailer.

### Justice

The principle of Justice explains the idea that vulnerable people should
be protected from researchers. As is the case for many research projects
in the digital age, we should have a richer definition of
"vulnerability" when assessing the "Justice" aspect of the Montana Flyer
Project. Instead of referring to disadvantages like low economic status,
the most relevant "vulnerability" in this project could be interpreted
as "Information Vulnerabiltiy" or vulnerability towards being
manipulated information-wise. As we have already discussed in the last
subsection, the quality of and the way this information is conveyed in
the mailer is subject to many controversies. For example, the footnote
in the mailer suggests receivers to look for more information on a
website, which is actually critical in fully understanding and
interpreting the political standing chart the mailer included. If the
receipient, however, does not have Internet access, he or she would
potentially be the victim of information manipulation has the
information provided is biased or faulted. The researchers have failed
in addressing the Justice concern of protecting those who are
information-underprivileged.

### Respect for law and public interest

This aspect is of direct relevance to the evaluation of the ethics of
the Montana Flyer Project, not only because the Commissioner of
Political Practices of the State of Montana (COPP) determined that the
researchers violated Montana law (including, but not limited to
513-37-226 MCA and all associated ARMs), but also due to the fact that
this research project's effect on supreme court justice election outcome
could impose a very large-scale social impact on the Montanan public. At
the core of this principle lies the "transparency-based accountability
at all stages of the research". However, the researchers of the Montanan
Flyer Project fails to report/disclose important information at various
stage of their researh. The prototype flyer project submitted by Prof.
Dropp to Dartmouth IRB is substantially different from the actual
project they carried out in Montana and Prof Rodden and Bonica from
Stanford have not even filed a proposal to Stanford's IRB, which is a
clear violation of required human-related research procedure.

Potential for experiment to effect the election outcome (Q2 - Q5)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, how (and under what conditions) this experiment study
could have potentially effected the election outcome will be discussed.
The discussion Will be separated into two parts: first on the potential
effect on election outcome due to study's sampling strategy for
participants and second on the information accuracy/quality's potential
effect on election outcome.

### Potential effect of sampling strategy

Whom these mailers have been sent to is central to the discussion of how
the study could have effected the election outcome, since the
sensitivity of voting behavior to this piece of information could have
differed substantially among different groups of registered voters.
Assuming two scenarios: one is that the majority of these mailers have
been sent to voters who are generally central in their political view
sphere (namely, neither too conservative nor too liberal) and the other
scenario is mailers been sent to voters far into both ends of the
liberal-conservative scale. It is not too unreasonable to assume that
this piece of information could potentially have a larger impact on
those centralists' voting decision while the effect might just be a
minor one for those holding relatively more polarized views.

During the investigation of the study, two extra piece of information
have put this concern of sampling strategy under the spotlight. One is
that Stanford stated that "the study deliberately excluded ideologically
'middle' precincts, focusing solely on precincts with 'a preponderance'
of either liberal or conservative voters. And the other piece of
information is that the sampling strategy is not that "random" ---
mailers were sent to 64,265 voters identified as likely liberal to
centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and 39,515 voters
identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts.
First, Stanford's answer on exlusion of middle precincts is not
evidence-based or convincing enough. Instead, it should have disclosed
more information on what specific criteria they were utilizing to
exlude/include certain voters, otherwise, the suspicision that it has
targeted more at "middle" voters could not be exlcuded. The other
information on the assymmetric distribution between conservative/liberal
precincts has deepened the concern, casting new doubts on whether the
sampling design is really neutral, which actually undermined the
credibility of the statement made by Stanford earlier. We will come back
to this point in the third subsection on discussing the "closeness of
the election outcome".

### Potential effect of information accuracy/unbiasedness

One of the major allegations that have been put against researchers of
this study is their appropriation of the Great Seal of Montana State.
The unathorized use of the Seal could be regarded as an enhancement to
the appearance of authority of the flyer, while, in reality, this
liberal-conservative scale charts are purely generated based on
researcher's calculation of donators' information to each campaign. The
misguided "authority" associated with the flyers could have increased
the weight of this piece of information in voters' decision-making
process, which could have not so significant an influence in voters'
decision-making without this appropriation of the Great Seal. Besides,
even if the concern of seal appropriation is set aside, whether the
information itself is calculated accurately or is reasonalble to be used
as a sole indicator of candidates' political ideology is subject to
further discussion, which has not been addressed under proper procedure
before the study being conducted. Besides, using Obama and Romney as
"benchmark" is not free of controversies since the chart could have
artificially transfered voters' preference over Obama vs Romney to the
preference over different Justice candidates. This potential preference
transfer would be even more problematic has the researchers' calculation
turn out to be biased/flawed.

We have been mainly focused on What conditions "could have potentially"
effected the election outcome, let's now turn to an analysis of how the
election really turns out and its relation with some of our hypotheses
earlier.

### The closeness of the election outcome

According to the election outcome, the race for Supreme Court Justice
\#1 has a dominant skewness towards Jim Rice (78.22% against the 21.59%
for W. David Herbert) while the race for Justice \#2 is a relatively
close one (~40% v.s. ~60%). When combining this result with the
liberal-conservative chart provided in the flyer, we couldn't rule out
the possibility that these mailers could have effected the election
outcome. I will further elaborate this point by proposing a hypothesis
below(PLEASE NOTE THAT THE HYPOTHESIS I PROPOSED IS NOT INDICATION OF
THE REAL CAUSALITY MECHANISM IN ANY SENSE):

#### A preliminary hypothesis on mailer's impact on election outcome: Candidates who were placed relatively in the middle ("relatively" referred to the comparison with the competitor and "middle" refers between Obama and Romney) in mailer's chart receive more votes in the election.

We state again this is just a hypothesis Which is very preliminary and
subject to criticism and the correlation between mailer's chart and
election outcome could represent other hidden variables like certain
attribute of candidates. However, the correlation mentioned in this
hypothesis is quite obvious via cross-comparison between election
outcome and the mailer's chart. Jim Rice is more middle than David
Herbert while Mike Wheat is leaning towards liberal almost as much as
Lawrence VanDyke is leaning towards conservative and it turns out Jim
Rice had a sweeping victory while Mike Wheat won by a smaller margin.
However, the fact that Mike Wheat is between Obama and Romney and won
the race for Judge \#2 could be an evidence in supporting the
hypothesis.

About CrowdPAC (Q6)
-------------------

It turns out one of the PI in the Montana flyer project(Adam Bonica) is
a co-founder of CrowdPAC, a for-profit company which "calculates
objective scores for political candidates showing their overall
political position". Given Prof. Bonica's involvement with a for-profit
company, the clients of which could be stakeholders in the election,
there exists a potential conflict of interests in the research project.
And this potential conflict of interests has NOT been addressed in the
mailer they send out or during other stages of the research.

Alternative design (Q7)
-----------------------

Based on all our evaluation of the Montana Flyer Project's ethics above,
we now turn to what alternative design we could make to improve the
soundness of the project in ethics aspect.

### Abiding with law and other required human-related research procedure

This could be regarded as the absolute baseline of a human-related
project like the Montana Flyer Project, which should, in no
circumstances, be breached. Before emabarking on the research project,
researchers should have proposed a detailed and complete design of their
experiment study to the IRBs of both institutions with full transparency
for review. Besides, Prof. Dropp's practice of proposing one study but
execute a substantially different one is not acceptable, the actual
implementation of the study should be in line with their proposed
design. Researchers should have also looked further into the details of
Montana election law and practice. It should also be followed with a
very detailed evaluation on how their experiment study could have
influeced the election outcome, and certain protection/risk-management
mechanism should be set up if any adverse event regarding the study and
election emerges.

### Better respect for persons to avoid involuntary participation

Without obtaining informed consent from participants of the experiment
study, researchers in the Montana Flyer Project directly send the
mailers out. One possible improvement in this aspect is to design a
mechanism trying to seek for Montana registered voters' consent first
before involving them in the study. For instance, a two-stage procedure
could be taken --- request for consent could be sent out to voters
first, then based on their response of whether they would be willing to
participate in the study, researchers could sample among those agreed
and send out the mailers accordingly (of course, some self-selection
issue needs to be addressed has this two-stage procedure been
practiced). It's also very important to constantly and consistenly
inform participants the academic nature of this experiment study at all
stages of the research. In the footnote section of the mailer (or better
earlier in the consent-seeking form), researchers should also state very
clearly the potential adverse effect this study could have on its
participants and the society as a whole. Though this approach could, in
some way, influence the quality of the research since voters' behavior
would no longer be a "purely revealed preference" given they know this
is an academic research. However, remedying approaches could also be
taken, for instance, researchers could utilize some more sophiscated
random sampling strategy based on the information they collected from
the consent-seeking forms or they could fully disclose the detailed
purpose of the study only after the project is over.

### Ensure there is no unintended/misguided perception of the information provided

One biggest allegation against the Montana Flyer Project is its
appropriation of the Great Seal of Montana State. To improve the
research's ethics soundness, researchers should ensure that no
perception of the source/credibility of the information they provided
should be misguided. To be more concrete, they should not use the Great
Seal in the mailer, instead, they could consider about using the icon of
Stanford/Dartmouth to reinforce the academic nature of this experiment
study.

Also, it should be made clearer on the mailer about how this
liberal-conservative scale has been calculated. In order to help
receipients interpret this chart more accurately, the
limitations/caveats in interpreting the chart should also be provided in
the mailer's footnote, instead of just a website link.

### Maintain frequent communication with all stakeholders at all stages

Since this experiment study could have influenced the course of society
and human objects in real life, disclosure on important details of the
study with requried transparency should be presented to all stakeholders
(e,g, State Office) at all stages of the research through frequent
communicationss. For example, as mentioned in the COPP's report, whether
the expenditure incurred by this project should be classified as a
campaign fund or an independent expenditure should be discussed by all
parties involved.
