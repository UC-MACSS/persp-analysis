##1. Assessing the study using four principles

### Respect for Persons
As quoted by [Bit by Bit](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/principles/respect-for-persons/) in Belmont Report, the *Respect for Persons Principle* holds that (1) individuals should be treated as autonomous and (2) individuals with diminished autonomy should be entitled to additional protections. Here, the researchers from Dartmouth and Stanford clearly did not adhere to the *Respect for Persons Principle*, in the following ways. 

First, they did not acquire informed consent from their sample population on whether they want to receive such information and be a part of the study, and thus failing to treat them as autonomous individuals capable of making their own decision. In the flyer sent out to more than 15% of the registered voter population, the researchers also did not make the statement that the receivers of the flyer are a part of a study designed to influence their voting behaviors. Granted, as mentioned by [Bit by Bit](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/dilemmas/consent/), informed consent does not have to be acquired when the lack of it is consistent with moral principles and existing rules. However, in this study, such is not the case, in that it is not intuitive whether telling them the design of the study and giving them the option not to participate in the study will make them more or less likely to vote in the election. A selection of information, at the discretion of the IRB councils (to be discussed in detail later) at the researchers' respective institutions, could have both preserved informed consent from the participants and exempted the study from potential Hawthorn effects where participants reacted in a biased way to the study with their knowledge of the study.

Secondly, as mentioned in the decision reached by the [Commission of Political Practices of the States of Montana](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf), researchers from both institutions failed to comply with IRB protocols to varying degrees. While the Stanford researchers did not report the study to Stanford's IRB council completely, researchers from Dartmouth only submitted a version of the flyer different from the one mailed to the voters to the IRB council. By their failure to comply with the IRB protocols, the will of the participants were not respected, and their interest could be subject to potential harm. 

Thirdly, individuals with diminished autonomy were not treated with additional protections in this study either. For example, people of lower socioeconomic classes change their addresses frequently. However, in this study, the flyer is sent out to Montanans indiscriminately of their socioeconomic status. Thus, in the delivery of treatment, the researchers are not considerate of individuals with diminished autonomy. What they could have done instead is having research assistants pay extra attention to those with frequent change of addresses by calling and physical presence.


### Beneficence
It is clear that the researchers, as benign researchers, meant no harm to the voters simply by providing them with more information via non-partisan and unbiased analyses of publicly available data, as repeatedly [reenforced](http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/05/12/stanford-and-dartmouth-researchers-broke-law-with-election-mailer-montana-official-says/) by spokespersons from both institutions. Indeed, more transparency does seem to promote social benefits, and should intuitively be conducive to modern democracy. However, the beneficence of the researchers did not translate into implementation, in the following ways.

First, as mentioned above, the biggest flaw of the study was the researchers' failure to comply with IRB protocols. Not only did such an act lead to a lack of respect for participants' will, it also exposes the participants to potential harms. For example, in the version of flyer that the Dartmouth researchers sent to their IRB council, there was no reproduction of the Great Seal of the State of Montana, which appeared in the final version of the flyer sent to voters' mailboxes. The method of scaling for ranking the candidates from conservative to liberal that appeared on the flyer was actually invented by the researchers themselves. Having the fake seal was a form of unjustified deception to the voters, under the facade of Montana's state authority (unauthorized), which the IRB council could have stopped.

Secondly, as mentioned in [Bit by Bit](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/principles/beneficence/), researchers should perform a risk/benefit analysis and find the ethical balance in making their decision. The social benefit of having the knowledge of whether more information will lead to more voter turnout is not salient, as the societal benefit of a greater voter turnout by an unknown margin is uncertain. The authors did not do a power analysis to assess such uncertainty. Contrarily, the risk of the study was clear: the potential of changing the result of an election. The sampled voters account for more than 15% of the total voter population, which makes the treatment of the study easily an influential factor in the election outcome, which could mean under- or misrepresentation of the voters of Montana. The authors also did not have the regulation of IRB in their efforts (if any) of trying to reduce harm and maximize benefits. The researchers also did not ask any Montanans to strike a favorable balance in the costs and benefits.



### Justice
The Belmont Report states that justice addresses the distribution of the burdens and benefits of research across all groups in the society. Here, justice was not upheld in this study in the following ways.

First, quintessentially the research wants to study whether more information will lead to more voter turnout in all elections in US. Were the study to be carried through, the benefits of the study would have benefited the American society as a whole by promoting democracy in US. However, the voters in Montana are the only ones bearing the burdens, risking mis-representation in a crucial election that could have policy implications for years to come. 

Secondly, the way that the sample was drawn is unknown to me. Were more people drawn from a specific population, the study, reaching more than 15% of all voters in Montana, would skew the result of the election towards the subpopulation. Also, the results will only be representative of that subgroup and not the population at large in US, making the benefits of the study distributed unevenly.

Thirdly, as mentioned above in the *Respect of Persons* section, the implementation of the study would downward bias the effect of treatment for people who move frequently, usually people of reduced socioeconomic circumstances. This will also make the results of the study not representative of that subpopulation and make the benefits of the study not equally distributed.


### Respect for Law and Public Interest

The researchers did not respect law or public interest in the following ways.

First, the research was a violation of Montanan law. In the decision reached by the [Commission of Political Practices of the States of Montana](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf), the commissioners determined that the study and researchers violated Montana campaign practice laws, and pointed out that the use of the Great Seal of Montana potentially violated the Montana state law. They made their decision on the classification of the flyer as "Express Advocacy", and not non-partisan extra information that the researchers asserted. They recognized the flyer as "unquestionably election and candidate focused and it was unquestionably focused on increasing voter turnout for a particular candidate, as determined by the targeted mailing". And thus, in compliance with the Montana law, the researchers should have registered their research as political activity, reported their spendings in the study as independent expenditure in the campaign, and disclose the study as public information. Unfortunately researchers failed to do any of the above. Eventually, the universities paid [$13,000 to the state of Montana](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/politics/stanford-and-dartmouth-pay-montana-k-settling-election-fiasco/article_3b366a5f-dcb0-5b18-b8e5-d55fed90e509.html) to prevent further lawsuit from Montana’s commissioner of political practices.

Secondly, as mentioned times and times again, the researchers did not seek IRB approval properly or at all, which was in direct violation of the universities' policies. 

Lastly, granted that the researchers were benign in their intentions towards public interest by promoting information transparency. However, the huge potential of influencing the outcome of an election resulted from the designed large sample number marked their neglect of public interest. Again, all could have been prevented if they sought IRB approval.

## 2. Random Sample
The effect of the treatment on the outcome of the election, by design, is the research question and is of great uncertainty. The hypothesized effect of the treatment is that it will increase voter turnout. With unknown likelihood, the treatment could also decrease voter turnout. So by design, if the flyer has indeed achieved a non-partisan effect, voters' decision should not be affected, but people who traditionally did not vote will now be represented in their votes. Depending on those who traditionally did not vote but now choose to vote in Montana(could be Republican or Democratic), the result of the election will be skewed that way.

Also, as mentioned in the *Beneficence* section, if the hypothesis of the study were true (that receiving the mail will result in higher likelihood to vote), the study will upward bias the voter turnout rate and thus representation of the populations who had address record on file and received the mail, which means under-representation of those who don't have public address on file or were frequent movers, usually those of reduced socio-economic standing.  

## 3. Non-random Sample
No. The design is still flawed ethically and by design. Since turnout rate is the research question of interest, instead of oversampling democrats, potentially biasing the results and definitely biasing the election outcome, they should compare the turnout rate in the treatment group with the one in control group and in history. In oversampling Democrats, by their hypothesis they are increasing the Democrat turnout rate and influencing the election results in Democrats' favor. In fact, this non-random targeted mailing contributed significantly in [Commission of Political Practices of the States of Montana's](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf) decision in labeling the research as biased "Express Advocacy" and thus a political action. With the obvious alternatives in sight, the fact that the authors still chose to oversample Democrats attests to their neglect of beneficence, justice and public interest, making the research ethically questionable.


## 4. Prediction
A truly ex ante (datable by record) analytic prediction of the research would somehow show researchers' benign intentions, and their efforts in doing the cost-benefit analysis in calculating the risks and benefits of the study. However, that still make the research ethically problematic because the prediction of the research is done in the interest of the researchers and not the Montanan people. IRB should be the gatekeeper of research participants' interest, and be the judge that can rule on the validity of such ex ante prediction, but they were absent in the study. Thus, the ex ante prediction still does not make the research comply with the principles of Respect for Persons, Beneficence, or Respect for Law and Public Interest. 

## 5. Election Results
This does not change my assessment of the research because the results are ex-post. All ethical evaluation of the design, which should be conducted by IRB, in addition to the four principles, should happen ex-ante. The results of the election can serve as reference in risk-benefit analysis (as discussed above), but should bear no significance in discussion here. 

## 6. CrowdPAC
Whether the candidates in the Montana election used CrowdPAC as a tool for funding and activism should be actively investigated. If yes, then it clearly biases Bonica adversely, in that he did not declare the conflict of interest to IRB or any other third party. The fact that the information that voters received was done by a for-profit company without the disclosure of such information exacerbates researchers' disrespect for persons, and undermines their beneficence by distorting their calculation of benefits. Were CrowdPAC proven to be partisan, justice and respect for law and public interest would also be undermined further in that the results, both of the study and of the election would be skewed towards that particular party. 

## 7. What I could do differently

This study is clearly ethically flawed. The following are a couple of things I would have done differently to make the research more ethically compliant.
### 1) Comply with IRB Council
The most obvious changes I would make to the study would be submitting it to the respective IRB Councils at Dartmouth and Stanford before sending out the mails. IRB probably would have 1) rejected the idea of adding fake Great Seal of the State of Montana, 2) required informed consent to an extent that wouldn't compromise the validity of study, 3) mandated a detailed risk-benefit analysis, 4) assess
