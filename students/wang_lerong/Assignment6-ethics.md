## Q1 Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

Respect for persons: Respect for persons consists of two parts: (1) individuals should be treated as autonomous, and (2) individuals with diminished autonomy should be entitled to additional protections, as stated in the book Bit by Bit (Salganik, 2017). Neither of the two basic principles are satisfied, and one of the most salient reasons that lead to unrespect for persons is that the study did not obtain any consent from the participants. Participants were not provided with relevant information in a comprehensible format that explains the process of the study. In other words, the study intended to be done secretly. Since researchers did the study without participants’ consent, this also means not all the participants agree to participate voluntarily. Researchers could have made the study more ethically permissible by obtaining the consent from participants. Also, the mailer was labeled as 2014 Montana General Election Voter Information Guide and included a reproduction of the Great Seal of the state of Montana, which may cause confusion because of the unclear source of the flyer. Later a letter was sent to participants who received the mailer with clarifications and asked participants to ignore the mailer. This whole process of unclear instructions and clarifications did not fully demonstrate respect for persons. Participants may feel like they were being manipulated because they were secretly involved in a study, which they were unaware of, and were simply told to ignore it afterward.

Beneficence: Researchers in the study did not intentionally harm any participants, but there may still be some unforeseeable impacts on the psychological state of the participants, which violates the two principles involved in the Belmont Report. If the participants in the study changed their minds after receiving the mailer and voted for a different candidate, but later after the election, they found the candidate who they voted for is not working in the way as they expected, and then they may regret voting for that candidate. This situation may be a potential psychological harm to the participants. Moreover, by knowing some partisan information to a non-partisan election, participants may lose some support for their state’s judicial system (Leeper, 2014). 
The principle of beneficence also involves a risk/benefit analysis and a decision about whether the risks and benefits strike an appropriate ethical balance (Salganik, 2017). I think researchers did not perform well on the risk and benefit analysis, especially the potential harm and disruption that the study can bring to the election system or even the whole society. 
The ultimate goal of this study is to measure whether voters are more likely to vote when given more information. If the study did end up with a conclusion that voters are more likely to vote when given more information, then this may be a potential benefit for the election system and the society. However, the study did not go as far as the researchers expected, so the beneficence is quite ambiguous. Thus, I would argue that the potential harm of the study weighs more than the potential beneficence.

Justice: Justice is about ensuring that the risks and benefits of the research are distributed fairly (Salganik, 2017). On an individual level, some registered voters in Montana are selected to participate in the experiment, but the objective of the study is to measure whether voters in the US are more likely to vote if given more information, so the selected participants suffered from burdens only. Also, the study intended to benefit the society as a whole in the sense that there could be a possible way to increase voter turnout. In this sense, the participants of the study bear the burdens of the research and the society as a whole benefits. On the level of the political party, if the outcome of the election is altered, and one party benefit from this experiment, then the other party suffered from the burden of the research, so it’s still an uneven distribution of the burdens and benefits.  

Respect for law and the public interest: In the Menlo Report, there are two aspects of respect for law and the public interest: (1) Compliance and (2) Transparency-based Accountability (Salganik, 2017). The researchers in the study did not show enough respect for law and public interest. As stated in the assignment, the commissioner determines that the researchers violated Montana campaign practice laws requiring registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures and moreover, the unauthorized use of the Great Seal of Montana was also debatable, so compliance was not handled well by the researchers in the sense that they did not attempt to identify and obey relevant laws, and terms of service. Since the researchers were doing things in secret, and participants were unaware of the existence of the study at the beginning, the transparency-based accountability was not handled well by researchers. Also, according to the Washington Post, the Montana study was never submitted to any IRB for approval. A study about “information and extremism in U.S. primary elections” involving the 2014 primary in the First Congressional District was submitted to the Dartmouth IRB, but this was a much different study than the Montana election study (Johnson, 2015).


## Conditions under which this experiment could effect the outcome of the election Q2

Assume the support rate for two groups of candidates were very close before the mailers were sent, and if the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters with a significantly uneven distribution of Democratic supporters and Republican supporters, the study could have altered the outcome of the election. Moreover, if there’s a discrepancy between the rankings shown in the mailer and the how the participants identify the rankings before seeing the mailer, then they might change their opinions and further alter the outcome of the election.  


## Conditions under which this experiment could effect the outcome of the election Q3

Since my assessment of respect for person, beneficence, and respect for law and public interest are more about the ethical problems of the overall design of the study, the non-random sample will not change my assessment of these three parts. However, my assessment of justice may change. I also become more questionable about the research design. The original goal of the experiment was to measure whether people are more likely to vote if given more information, so it makes no sense to me to draw the sample from uneven distribution of voters and reduce the discrepancy of the election result in an intention way. Rather than drawing the sample from uneven distribution, I think researchers should compare the overall voter turnout rate and voter turnout rate between the two parties with historical data to see whether the rate increases or not. By sending the mailer to a non-random sample of voters, the researchers seemed to benefit Democrats more, which may raise the issue of the principle of justice. Moreover, I do not think it is reasonable to take “they anticipated turnout to be significantly lower among Democratic voters” into account when designing and delivering the research design, because first, there is no explicit proof and empirical evidence showing that what the researchers anticipated is true, and second, by taking this into account, the consideration itself is already an injustice showing that there’s something inherently different between Democratic and Republican. 



## Closeness of the election Q4

This further information will not change my assessment of the research. Although the researchers showed that they did not intend to interrupt the election system, the ethical problems that I have discussed in the first section, except some beneficence problem, still remain. Most of the ethical problems are irrelevant to the intention of the researchers, but rather, they are more related to properly design the study by obeying the rules and laws, handling justice properly, and showing respect for participants. 



## Closeness of the election Q5

This does not change my previous assessment. The ethical problems still remain. I become more questionable about the beneficence and justice part of the research. The election results are not close. However, if we take a look at the flyer, both Jim Rice and Mike Wheat were leaning toward more liberal side than their competitors. The discrepancy between the result in Supreme Court Justice #1 is rather large, and we are less likely to say that the election result would be affected by the experiment. However, for Supreme Court Justice #2 where the discrepancy between the election results was not as large as the first one, we don’t know whether the election outcome will be different without the experiment. Researchers claimed that the mailer “is non-partisan and does not endorse any candidate or party,” but Democrat did benefit more from the research design and finally won the election. We don’t know whether this so-called “nonpartisan flyer” endorse any political party or not, but it’s hard for an observer not to link the association together. 


## Importance of CrowdPAC Q6

This does not change my previous assessment of the study, and I even become more questionable and raise doubts about the real objective of the study. My evaluation of the Beneficence part becomes more negative after knowing this additional information. If the research was conducted by three professors for academic and exploratory reasons, then the result of the experiment may benefit the society as a way to promote turnout rate. However, if Adam Bonica is the co-founder of CrowdPAC, a for-profit company, I have reasons to doubt the real objective of the study, the truthfulness of the objective scores, and the intention of taking advantage of the data.


## What would you do differently? Q7

If I were the principal investigator of the study, I would follow the four principles offered by the Belmont Report and the Menlo Report: respect for persons, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. 
First, I will obtain consent from the participants. Before the study, I will send out mailers with consent forms in which participants will be introduced that we are conducting a political science research and recruiting participants. To ensure the unbiasedness of the experiment, I will not include the true objective of the study in the consent form, but there will be potential harm listed on the consent form for them to consider. I will also include my institution in the consent letter, and instead of using the Great Seal of Montana, I will use my institution logo. If they agree to participate, then I will ask them to sign the consent form and mail the form back to me in the return envelopes I provide. The principle of beneficence is hard to guarantee because there’s no foreseeable beneficial impact on participants, but I will try to minimize the harm of the study by providing as detailed information as possible, and letting participants quit whenever they feel offended. To ensure justice between the two political parties, I will carefully decide the number of mailers sent to different precincts by using sampling-matching techniques. 
I will carefully handle the law-related issue. While designing the study, I will consult the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana and discuss the reasonable scope of the research influence, and what sample size they think is reasonable to minimize the effect the study could have on the election system. Before the experiment starts, I will register, report and disclose independent expenditures. I will also submit my study to IRB for advice and approval.
