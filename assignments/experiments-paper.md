# Short Paper #4: Proposing an Experiment

Previously you have written proposals to conduct observational and survey-based studies. This week we have assessed how randomized controlled experiments can be used to draw inferences, assert causal relationships, and identify mechanisms for changes in behavior.

In a short paper (maximum of 3 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, 1 inch margins, paragraph format [no columns]), propose a research study based on the same research topic from your previous papers and explain how you would use a computationally-enhanced experiment to answer your question. You should (briefly) restate your topic of interest and the specific question you seek to answer in this research project. Next, identify the basic structure and format of the experiment.

The bulk of your proposal should be a critical assessment of why you believe this project will be a good example of experimental research. This includes:

* A clearly stated research question
* A clearly stated plan for using a computationally-enhanced experiment
    * Your experiment does not have to be fully digital. At minimum, you need at least one of the four steps (recruit participants, randomize, deliver treatments, and measure outcomes) to utilize digital systems.
* An assessment of the experimental design
    * This should include a discussion of the experiment's validity and its ability to measure heterogeneity of treatment effects and causal mechanisms
    * Your experiment may not maximize all of these components. If you decide to concentrate on one just one specific aspect (for instance, only estimating the average treatment effect) or have to make trade-offs (e.g. sacrificing external validity for internal validity), justify these decisions.

NOTE: Please use the same research topic as in your previous proposals. An objective of this assignment is to compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of these research design methods. This is best achieved if you can evaluate the same topic using different methodologies.

## Submitting your assignment

All assignments for this course should be submitted via [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). The basic workflow for homework should be:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [assignment repository](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis-assign)
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files and [commit changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) to complete your paper/problem set.
1. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes up to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. *Make sure to include your name in the pull request.*

Once you have forked the repository the first time, you do not need to make a new fork for each assignment. Rather, [sync your fork with the upstream repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). This will merge updates to the assignment repository with your fork.

Dr. Evans has written a guide to using [GitHub and this specific workflow](../handouts/git_tutorial.pdf) you may find useful.

### Paper format

You may write your paper in whatever format you wish (e.g. Word document, PDF, Markdown). As long as we can read it, we will review and grade it. *Please don't make it difficult for us to do that.*

### Submission deadline

Submit your paper before class on Monday, November 7th (11:30 am).
