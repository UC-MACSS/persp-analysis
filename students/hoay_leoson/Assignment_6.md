## <a name = "principles"></a>Four Principles of Ethical Research (Q1) 

It is difficult to weigh the four principles as separate entities, but this essay will begin by examining them in turn.

Respect for persons, as outlined by Salganik, deals with the protection of individuals' autonomies, and the additional protection of those with diminished autonomy([1]). Clearly, two boxes should be checked: 1）Participants should be informed, and 2) Participants should participate of their own volition. In the Montana experiment, a quick review yields the observation that this principle is not well-fulfilled by the study. First of all, prior consent was not obtained from the participants. We know this from the Political Practices Decision Document([2]) and from the description of their methodology - the participants likely did not know that the flyers were about to arrive in their mailbox before they actually did. Moreover, the information provided prior to the flyers' arrival was non-existent, and that provided along with the flyers themselves did not disclose the actual details of their "research project". However, providing complete information and obtaining consent beforehand would directly impact the response of the participants, so perhaps alternatives can be considered. In the Montana experiment, the fact that the guide was provided as part of a project was stated on the mailer, albeit in small print. One could then argue that participants could choose not to read the rest of the mailer or "opt out" of taking into the account the information provided in the mailer, given that they were made aware that it was part of a research project. However, since it is highly likely that the rest of the mailer was read before the fine print, and that the stimuli was the mailer itself, the argument is moot. I believe that because of these reasons, the Respect for Persons principle was not upheld.

Beneficience refers to striking a balance between risks and benefits. While the findings of the experiment will likely produce actionable insights for future political efforts, the imminent judicial race meant that the methods used by the experiment had potential to affect the results in an unknown manner. Given that 102, 780 is a rather significant slice of the voters in Montana, it would not be unfair to say that the risks (of unknown magnitude) involved are significant even when compared with the potential long run benefits of the study. From the above, I believe that beneficience is also not upheld well in this study.

Justice is defined by ensuring a fair distribution of costs and benefits of the study to the society. While in the case of clinical studies it is usually the attempt to distribute the positive effects of a treatment equally, the individual participant in the Montana study does not bear any obvious costs or benefits from receiving the mailer. However, at the societal or national level, the findings of the study and the effects that it might have on the imminent judicial race are isolated in Montana, and includes only a portion of the voters in Montana. From this standpoint, one might argue that the costs and benefits of the study are not well-distributed throughout and represented by society. However, notwithstanding the poor adherence to Beneficience and Respect for Persons, I believe that the principle of Justice in this study is upheld, or at least not significantly transgressed.

As mentioned above, this study was conducted in the light of an upcoming race, and the fact that this was a research project was not made clearly known to the participants beforehand - included in relatively small print, reveals some disregard for public interest. Moreover, the Great Seal was reproduced in the flyer, which may have instilled a false sense of authority to the flyer and misappropriated a symbol of the state. Even if it was not conducive to the study to provide full disclosure to the participants, it might have been a boon to the project's transparency to disclose the process to relevant authorities that oversee the election process. Instead, a formal complaint was eventually issued and followed-up upon. Even though the mailer supposedly states its non-partisanship and non-endorsement, its "explicitness" in doing so is debatable. Hence, I believe that there was not sufficient respect considered for the law and public interest prior to the study's execution. 


## <a name = "sampling"></a>Random and Non-Random Sampling (Q2, Q3)

If the random sampling of the voters was not stratified by political affiliation, the results could have been altered if one affiliation or the other was overrepresented in the sample population, assuming that the mailer did provide a significant effect on voter turnout. Also, eligible voters who do not vote may have a particular inclination towards one party - and for sets of voters who happen to receive favorable information regarding the party they prefer, through the possible cognitive mediator of the confirmation effect, will be more likely to be driven to vote than the other individuals. Even though the mailer "relied upon public information", it will be more likely to convince those with preexisting inclinations towards to the favorably presented party.

Given that the researchers did not use random sampling and did some level of stratification, there was some attempt to correct the possible ramifications that stem from a simple random sample. However, given that they still provided a different number of mailers to the separate subgroups - the justification given may make sense for the estimation of effects in the study, but does not aid in the cases of Beneficience and Respect for Public interest - it does not change my assessment of the design. Given the hypothesized effect of providing more information to voters, these principles are still violated by virtue of the effect actually existing and the fact that differing quantities of stimuli were delivered to the separate affiliations.


## <a name = "impact"></a>Not Closely Contested? (Q4, Q5)

The fact that the researchers did do a prior analysis on the 2014 election results in order to determine if their experiment would have an effect on the outcome shows that they did have some prior consideration regarding Respect for Public Interest and Beneficience. Assuming their analysis was thorough and valid, it would improve my assessment of the research design regarding these two principles. However, since the analysis is still based on past data (the point of an election is to ensure a renewed democratic process), the risks still belong to the realm of the unknown. Nevertheless, this step does indeed improve the study's placement on the ethical spectrum.

The eventual outcome of the election does not change my assessment of the study beyond the previously provided information. First of all, since there is no time-insensitive "control group", there is no way to tell if these results have indeed been influenced by the mailers or not, and if so, to what degree. Secondly, when the study was conceived, the outcome of the election had not yet been decided and hence post-hoc results should not be considered in an ethical assessment of the study - the concern is with how the study was designed beforehand in order to maximize its ethical justifiability.   


## <a name = "crowdpac"></a>CrowdPAC (Q6)

Knowing that Bonica is also a co-founder of CrowdPAC might change my assessment of the study's consideration of the Beneficience principle, depending on how the investigators planned to use the data and results and whether they laid out a specific data protection policy. There will definitely be some conflict of interest if the study was pitched as an academic endeavour but allowed its data to be used in profit-generating processes. The principle Justice will also be called into question if the benefits of the study were directed into CrowdPAC while the risks of the study were borne by the society at large. Even though CrowdPAC's website([3]) explicity states its non-partisanship, the for-profit nature of the company already skews the distribution of the beneficiaries of its services to those who can easily afford them.


## <a name = "design"></a>Potential Study Design Changes? 

Although this may be easy to conceive on hindsight, the principal investigators should have expected some level of backlash regarding the methods of their study. The first thing that I would have done differently would be to consult with relevant political authorities beforehand, and through discussions obtain some form of an "ethical green light" as a bulwark against potential future complaints and legal issues. Secondly, I would have made the fact that this was part of a beneficial research study even more explicit in the mailers sent out to participants so that I would be more confident that this information did reach individual participants. Thirdly, included with the mailers should be a return feedback form addressed back to the researchers, which directly asks the participants if they were comfortable or happy with receiving these mailers and if they had any complaints, and if so, they could fill in the return form. Aside from giving participants a greater sense of security, this will also allow researchers to monitor any possible complaints and backlash that the may elicit, and deal with them as they happen.

However, if I wanted the study to be far more ethical than in its current state, I would not conduct this experiment in the context of an election that has real world impact. Although it might be more costly, I would set up an arbitrary (but still seemingly important) political scenario where participants are required, and conduct the experiment using that scenario. Deception will have to be deployed to convince the participants of the necessity of their vote. In this case, I would expect one ethical concern to be that participants were made to do something they thought was important to their political life, but was actually not so - and the process itself might affect participants' political inclinations and voting motivations for future elections. However, I believe that with proper post-hoc debriefing procedures that thoroughly explain the study and its benefits, this problem can be mitigated.
