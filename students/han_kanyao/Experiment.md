# What Kind of Homophobia? An Experiment That Evaluates Various Homophobic Attitudes Toward Homosexuality

## Introduction to My Research Question     

Social Scientists often talk about homophobia. However, different social scientists' measurements of homophobia are relatively different. For example, some polls often ask people whether they support homosexuality and conclude that those who dislike homosexuality are homophobic people. On the other hand, some researchers evaluate the degree of homophobia by asking gay people's living condition, such as what kind of bullying they suffer. However, both two methods have their drawbacks. First, Doan, Loehr and Miller (2014) find that heterosexuals in the United States are more willing to support same-sex marriage than to grant informal privileges such as public displays of homosexual affection. In other words, although many people say they support homosexual identity, they still feel uncomfortable when they see homosexual behavior. Second, Birkett and Espelage (2009) find that students in the United States who question their own sexual orientation would self-report higher bullying than both LGB and heterosexual students. This finding suggests that the higher self-reported bullying may at least partly result from failed self-identification rather than really existing bullying because no evidence shows that those who question their sexual identity would encounter more hostility from peers than LGB students. Therefore, self-reported living condition may mislead the evaluation of homophobia. Third, some researches show that gay people are generally more feminine so that people may just dislike feminine men rather than homosexual identity.     

Therefore, homophobia is a very tricky concept because it can refer to too many different things. In this case, I plan to divide this concept into different parts: homophobic attitudes towards homosexual identity, homosexual behavior and just some characteristics usually related to homophobia (such as men's feminine appearance). Through experiment I want to answer the question which parts of homosexuality lead to people's negative attitudes toward homosexuality, or put differently, what kind of homophobia there is. Given people's different attitudes toward gay and lesbian, in this experiment I only evaluate people's attitudes toward gay.

## Recruitment
I plan to recruit participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. I will pay them some money if I have enough research funding. Because the experiment will only last less then 10 minutes and the average payment level in AMT is very low compared  to traditional experiments, I can recruit a certain number of participants with relatively low cost. Recruitment will last several months and participants can finish experiment at any time within these period. All steps of this experiment are digital and online.

## Research Design    

1. **First Step**     
Participants are required to finish a very short survey first. It contains some demographic questions such as age, education level, race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion and political standpoint (Liberals, Conservatives or Others). If participants feel some questions are too private, they can skip certain questions or just stop this survey at any time. Besides, they are also required to answer whether they have gay friends and their attitude towards homosexuality (oppose, neither oppose nor support, support). 

2. **Second Step**    
Participants will be randomly divided into three groups. the first group will be told that they will hear and watch some gay people's behavior. The second group will be told it is straight people's behavior. The third group will skip this step.

3. **Third Step**  
I will prepare three videos. Participants will randomly watch only one of them. The contents of the first two videos are similar: a man is speaking. However, in the first video, he behaves a little bit feminine and in the second video behaves traditionally masculine. Besides, two videos are dubbed. The dub in first video is somewhat feminine voice and that in the second video is traditionally masculine voice. The third video is exactly the same as the second one. The only difference is that this man kisses another man after speaking.

4. **Fourth Step**     
Finally participants will be asked their impression on the man in one of the videos they watch. Measurement scale are from 1 point to 5 point (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive). Lower score indicates more negative impression.

## Measurement 

1. Homosexual Identity -> Homophobia 
We can compare people in three groups who watch the same video. If the people in first group, who are told that the man in the video is gay, have a more negative impression on him than other groups who watch the same video, we can conclude identity can cause homophobia. Here the casual mechanism is homosexual identity.

2. Gender Expression(Femininity) -> Homophobia
In this measurement we can respectively compare people in the same groups who watch the first video and second video. If the people watching the first video have a more negative impression on the man than the people watching the second video , we can conclude femininity can cause homophobia given that gay are generally more feminine than heterosexual men. Here the casual mechanism is gender expression.

3. Homosexual Behavior -> Homophobia?
We can also respectively compare people in the same groups who watch the second video and third video. If the former have a more positive impression on the man than the latter, we can conclude homosexual behavior can cause homophobia. Here the casual mechanism is homosexual behavior,

## Vadility    

- Statistical Conclusion Validity    
Because of the low cost of digital experiment, I can obtain much larger sample size than traditional experiment. Larger samples size means it is safer to adopt a more rigorous statistical inference standard. For example, I can adopt a much lower P value threshold to reduce the probability of type-1 error without worrying about type-2 error.      

- Internal Validity
This experiment is totally digital. As long as the digital system does not have bugs, the internal validity of this experiment can be guaranteed. Besides, because this experiment is not time-consuming and survey questions are considerable clear and easy, I believe most participants would not lose tolerance and misunderstand questions.

- Construct Validity    
One of this experiment's goals is to solve the drawbacks of theoretical constructs in traditional social studies of homophobia. As I mentioned in the introduction, this experiment will transform the abstract homophobia and homosexuality into very specific concepts such as identity, behavior and gender expression. Therefore, theoretical constructs can become more clearly in my research design.     

- External Validity    
External validity should be seriously considered in my research design since the environmental setting in this experiment may be far away from natural society. My solution is to conduct some in-depth interviews with some participants. If most interlocutors' life experiences are similar with the results in this experiment, this research has a high external validity. If their experience are different, we can also adjust the experiment setting (such as the content of video) according to their experiences.

## Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects
There is a survey in my research design that is used for collecting participants' demographic information. Therefore, if we hope to understand a certain group of people, we can reconstruct a set of data based on the demographic information to fit the composition of group that we want to study. As I mentioned above, this experiment can obtain a larger sample size with considerably lower cost than traditional experiment, it is possible for us to reconstruct data.

## Causal Mechanism
The casual mechanisms in this  experiment has been discussed in the section of measurement. In summary, many researches in social sciences only consider the casual inference between abstract concept such as homosexuality and homophobia. In other words, many people just say some people are discriminated because they are gay. However, this research runs experiments with slightly different versions of treatment (three groups with different/no information plus watching slightly different video), and thus it is more easy to find the possible mechanisms, that is, homosexual identity, feminine expression and homosexual behavior.
