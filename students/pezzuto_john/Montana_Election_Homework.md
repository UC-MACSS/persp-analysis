The ethics of the Montana election experiment
================

1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Respect for persons

Respect for persons is the idea of treating people and their judgment as autonomous, and getting their consent. The researchers did not respect persons before conducting the experiment. It is true that this was a fairly large mailing of over 100 thousand letters and that it would be hard to get each person’s individual consent, but the state of Montana does have elected representatives. The universities in question could have gotten consent from the elected officials before conducting the experiment, which would have been at least a step towards being satisfactory. However, this would not have been a perfect solution because using representatives does undermine the autonomy of participants to some degree. 

The researchers also deceived people by using the Great Seal of Montana. This may have misrepresented them as affiliated with the government which was not the case. In fact, none of the universities mentioned were affiliated with the state of Montana at all! The mailer would have been more transparent if they included the logos from their home institutions so that participants would know that these are researchers from out of the state,  but instead the logos from the home institutions were only included with the apology letter.

The blurb does not state anything explicitly about IRB approval, but the court documents seem to show that the IRB process was “properly engaged” and that it was completely ignored the process. This runs clearly counter to respect for persons.

##### Beneficence

Beneficence is the idea of maximizing the possible benefits and minimizing the possible harms. Beneficence is more difficult to judge. The researchers may not have caused any harm explicitly, but there may have been underlying harm. For example, Montana is a fairly red state. By placing candidates visibly on the left side of the spectrum (particularly for a supposed nonpartisan election), certain people could have been excluded from their communities for voting for a candidate on the left of the spectrum.

The benefits from the study are not as clear. It could be that this study offers confirmatory information about for Bonica’s model on campaign spending, or it could be that that by seeing candidates on the political spectrum that voters become mobilized. However in my opinion, it seems that in a risk/benefit analysis, that the risks would outweigh the benefits.


##### Justice

Justice is the idea of evenly distributing burden and benefits. As the experiment is currently explained, the experiment may or may not be just. The blurb states, that the mailers were sent to registered voters in the state of Montana, but does not clarify beyond that. We do know that participants were not compensated and that it was a sample distributed around the state of Montana. Was there a control group of non-registered voters? It is not inherently clear if the burdens and benefits were evenly distributed.

##### Respect for law and public interest

This is the principle of essentially not breaking the law. The researchers did end up getting in trouble with the law, by violating “Montana campaign practice laws requiring registration", and by not "reporting [the] disclosure of independent expenditures,” and so it seems they did not respect and try to understand Montana law before conducting this experiment. 

The researchers also used the Great Seal of Montana in a way which may or may not be illegal, but does at a minimum not indicate respect for the law. As previously stated, the blurb does not indicate that the the researchers attempted to obey relevant laws and contracts which is why there was backlash in the first place. Breaking the law in some cases when it is fairly harmless (e.g. webscraping), but deception on a massive scale is not in the public interest.


2. Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the mailers were sent to random voters, and because Montana is mostly a red state, if we assume that everyone was equally impacted by the fliers, it is likely that the mailers would have helped secure a spot for the candidates on the right of the spectrum (because Montana has historically voted right). However, I don't think this stands against any of the previous principles mentioned before. It may have impacted elections if the a popular candidate was shown to not be on the place of the political spectrum that voters originally thought.

3. In fact, the mailers were not sent to a random sample of voters. Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the researchers especially targeted Democratic voters under the justification that they “were less likely to show up”. This stands against the principle of justice which involves equally distributing the benefits and burdens of conducting good research. I initially thought that the research design was going to be about educating voters, but now this research design appears to be more about mobilizing voters. It is a little suspect that the researchers decided to emphasize a marginalized voter population, though I don’t think this is inherently unethical. This could have impacted the outcome of the election if the researchers were wrong about how mobile the Democratic voters were and they had an especially high turnout this year (before the survey was administered).

4. In response to the investigation, the researchers said that they picked this election in part because "neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This comment seems like it does not follow the principle of "respect for persons." I do think it is good that the researchers did not try to tamper with a close election, and likewise, it is likely true that the mailers likely did not impact the election, but it is also possible that the researchers could have had an inadvertent impact they were not prepared for. It is not the researchers place to decide whether or not that their widespread mailer will change the outcome of any contest no matter what the results initially appear to be.

5. In fact, the election turned out to be not particularly close. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This seems like a step in the correct direction. From this, it is not clear what impact the mailer had, if any, on the outcome of the election. The resolution of mailer is not clear, but it looks like the two left leaning candidates both won the election. It is not clear that these were the initially preferred candidates, though even if they were, I could still find myself upset if I was a voter from Montana and voted for one of the losing candidates – the mailer would seem like a reasonable alibi. I still stand by my previous point that it is not the researchers place to decide whether or not that their widespread mailer will change the outcome of any contest regardless if this time things worked out the way they expected.

6. One of the principal investigators for the Montana election study of CrowdPAC. CrowdPAC also provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns (all for a fee). Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am under the impression that CrowdPAC is just the application of Adam Bonica's model on campaign donations and political stance which we read about in class. I think it is likely they used the same models offered by CrowdPAC to place the politicians on the spectrum, and I am not sure if he charged the universities to use CrowdPAC, but if he did, I consider that to be a conflict of interest. It is likely that if this research went well, Bonica would have used it to attract more customers to CrowdPAC and create more profit.

I think the most similar metaphor for Bonica using his own method is that of professor's assigning their own textbooks in class. Yes, most students find this to be "cashing out", but from the professor's point of view, what could they do instead? It would be a little weird, if the professor wrote their own textbook and then decided to assign another person's textbook for their own class. It would give people the impression that the professor's textbook is of lower quality. This study is an example of Bonica pushing his model which in all fairness seems to work pretty well, but could easily be a conflict of interest in regards for public interest (e.g. using taxpayer/student tuitions to run experiments that forward his company, or annoy people with mailers so that his company can become more famous.)

This makes me question Bonica as a person for the aforementioned reasons, but admittedly that includes some speculation, and it is not related to the value of the research.

7. What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I was the principal investigators of this study, I would have especially emphasized following Salganik's four principles. I would try and *respect persons* by getting consent from state officials before conducting this experiment as a proxy for consent from the voters. Alternatively, if we had the resources, setting up at polling stations and getting voters to opt in for next year, that would be even better.  Likewise, I would make sure to not leave any ambiguity about my affiliations meaning that I would only use the Great Seal of Montana if I had state approval and it could be made clear I was not affiliated with the government of Montana. Similarly, I think the institutional affiliation of the researchers should have been included in the mailers.

Likewise, I would try and balance *beneficence* as well as possible. The harms were social pressure to conform, but the benefits were not so clear for people who received mailers. In recreating this experiment, I would try and create benefits that would be more clear to participants by including information about the benefits of voter mobilization.

The experiment could have been more *just*, by balancing the fliers between Democrats and Republicans. As explained, the Democrats have lower turnout rates than Republicans, so they needed increased mobilization. However, I believe this falls could become a dangerous argument because “lower turnout” is not well defined, and it is not fair to emphasize helping one party without helping the other.

In regards to *the law*, I would certainly recommend speaking to someone who is very familiar with law in Montana before conducting this experiment. There may have been other laws that the researchers did not get called out on this time. It is important to not break the law, and I would encourage our team to ere on the side caution.
