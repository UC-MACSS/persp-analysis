## Research Question

This study will investigate weekly, seasonal, and annual trends in food security across isolated Canadian communities. The principal research question will be:

  * How does food insecurity change by month and season in isolated Canadian communities?
  
With sub research questions:

  * To what extent do traditional food acquisition strategies mitigate food insecurity?
    
  * Are there intra-seasonal periods of increased food insecurity?
    
For the purposes of this study, Government of Canada standard definitions apply (see Government of Canada). Food insecurity  will be understood as a state where households were uncertain of having, or unable to access enough food to meet the needs of all their members because they had insufficient money for food. Food security will be a state where households have access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. Isolated communities will be identified based on Treasury Board of Canada criteria. The Treasury Board defines isolation in terms of population, climate, and availability of commercial transportation/access by all-weather roads, as well as its position relative to the 60th parallel. (National Joint Council 2017) 

The target population is all people living in isolated communities. The frame population will be adults with children living in isolated communities who own mobile phones or comparable devices. The sample population will be a function of the selection procedure, which is described in more detail below. 
    
## Motivation
    
Findings from this study may allow for improvements to government policy on northern food insecurity, specifically in the context of the Nutrition North initiative. (Dietitians of Canada 2016) Nutrition North provides subsidies to improve access to perishable foodstuffs in isolated and remote communities. With a more clear picture of intra-seasonal or weekly fluctuations in food security, Nutrition North and affiliated programs can more effectively prioritize resources. 

## Digitally Enhanced Survey Design

This survey will leverage the advantages of momentary ecological assessment to deliver numerous, short survey questionnaires to respondents over the course of an entire year. Through mobile device-based surveys, respondents in isolated communities will respond to standard questions designed to identify food insecurity.

While digitally enhanced methods generally focus on areas of high connectivity, this study will also explore how digital enhancement can allow for improved access to remote areas and areas of low or infrequent connectivity. Through an application installed on respondents' device, they will be prompted to answer questions at specified time-based intervals. If the respondent is in a location with mobile connectivity, the answers will be sent via text message (or equivalent) to the researcher. In areas with no connectivity, the device will store the (encrypted) responses for sending when connectivity is restored (e.g., when the respondent travels to a larger town). 

### Respondent Selection

Respondents will be drawn from the population of adults living in isolated communities in Canada.  Following the Treasury Board of Canada's definition, there are 277 communities in Canada that qualify as isolated. (National Joint Council 2017)

Due to small population sizes in the areas being studied, as well as the inherent remoteness of the sample population, a non-random sample will be used. Respondents will be recruited through in-person recruitment and outreach to local community organizations and government. Upon recruitment, data on demographics, family size, income, and ethnicity will be collected in order to weight final results relative to 2016 Census data. (Statistics Canada, 2017) 

Respondents will be motivated through a credit applied to their telecommunications bill. In collaboration with telecommunications service providers, the application's communications with the researcher's server will not incur additional costs for the user. The exact amount of the credit disbursed to respondents may vary depending on the result of funding applications. This reward has been selected over other options (e.g., coupons for groceries) as it is removed from the issue being investigated and therefore less likely to create systematic bias in results. 

### Questionnaire
The survey questionnaire will use questions from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (Statistics Canada) to encourage comparisons with other food security monitoring tools. Not all questions will be asked to maintain brevity. Some questions will be adapted to reflect a custom time frame.

#### Question Selection and Timing
Questions FSC_Q010, FSC_Q015, and FSC_Q030 (below) will be asked at pre-determined intervals, or based on previously successful question timing (where success is defined by a completed questionnaire). Questions will be asked at most twice per week to avoid survey fatigue. Moreover, to ensure assessments capture a complete picture of respondents' food security,  one  question will be added, which focuses on traditional food acquisition and use. This question will be asked at the end of each week, based upon the supposition that traditional food acquisition practices are more likely to occur outside the work week, with consumption lasting through to the beginning of the next weekend. Incorporating traditional food acquisition will help to mitigate food security's conceptual bias towards southern, sedentary or urban lifestyles (Power 2008).

#### Sample Questionnaire:

_Adapted from Canadian Community Health Survey, 2016 updated version (in Statistics Canada 2016)_

For these questions, [time period] represents the time elapsed since the most recent response, or one week, whichever is shortest. All questions use the same set of answers as enumerated in FSC_Q10. 

 * FSC_Q10: [You and other household members] worried that food would run out before you got money to buy more. Was this often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?
      * Often true
      * Sometimes true
      * Never true
      * Refused (RF)
      * Don't know (DK)
  * FSC_Q015: The food that [you and your household members] bought just didn't last, and there wasn't enough money to get more. Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?

  * FSC_Q030: [You or other adults in your household] couldn't feed [the children] a balanced meal, because you couldn't afford it. Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?

  * Traditional food sources: In the past [time period], [you or other adults in your household] and [the children] ate mostly food [you or other adults] got from hunting, fishing, trapping, picking wild fruits and vegetables, or farming? 


### Representation Error Mitigation
The risk of the selected participants (adults who were recruited and own mobile devices) not representing the target population is judged to be manageable. While children are not being included as participants, their interests will be reflected through questions such as PSC_Q030, which explicitly prompt respondents to consider the interest of minors in their care. While some coverage error may occur due to the requirement for a mobile device, the relative ubiquity of cellular coverage or an equivalent (Voice Over Internet Protocol) across most isolated communities mitigates this concern.

### Measurement Error Mitigation

Sampling error is also a risk, especially as this study will use a relatively small, non-random sample. For this reason, the incentive offered to participants will not be directly related to food security, to avoid systematic inclusion of chronically food insecure participants. Bias from question wording will be mitigated through using widely-accepted survey questions. Sampling bias from the non-random sample will be addressed through weighting responses. 

The risk of non-response for a longitudinal study can be high. However, this study design will mitigate this risk by limiting questionnaires to twice per week at a maximum to limit survey fatigue. Respondents will also be motivated by a credit applied to their telecommunications account. 

## Added Value Relative to Traditional Surveys and Observational Methods

Relative to observational methods, a survey will allow insight into behaviours which are not normally recorded with digital traces, such as subsistence hunting or fishing. Other variables of interest, such as personal finances and their impact on eating habits, would be difficult to study with observational data. This is primarily due to privacy concerns regarding finances and a lack of readily available digital traces to quantify target individuals' decision making processes. Moreover, cash or barter economies in remote areas do not lend themselves to digital trace observation. Observational approaches to this research question might leverage purchase records at larger grocery stores to extract food prices, however such a research design would not be workable in remote communities that are supplied by sea or air. 

The proposed approach has three principal advantages relative to traditional surveys such as the CCHS. First, by posing a shorter set of questions at frequent intervals, it will be possible to capture fluctuations in food security not only year to year (as in CCHS), but between months or even weeks. Second, as questionnaires are shorter, the survey will have a smaller footprint and it is believed it will be less burdensome to the respondent. This is likely to encourage higher response rates. Third, the flexible nature of mobile-delivered surveys will allow  low-cost data collection in permanently or seasonally remote and hard-to-reach areas. This last point in itself is a significant advantage given the costs of travelling and working in remote areas.

## Conclusion

Adapting an approach previously used in high-connectivity areas, this study will leverage digitally enhanced survey techniques to conduct ecological momentary assessments over the course of a year. Through this approach, this study will contribute a more nuanced, more granular, and quantifiable measure of food insecurity. These findings will be of use to policymakers and researchers in food security and scholars of rural/remote areas.
