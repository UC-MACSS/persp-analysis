# HW 6 Ethics 
##Q1

###Respect for Persons  

According to the Belmont Report, the principle of Respect for Persons requires researchers to treat people as automonous or provide additional protections to people with diminished autonomy. To comply with the principle, researchers generally ask for consent from experiment participants before executing the experiment. However, in the Montanan Flyer project, the mailers were sent without informed consent to 102,780 voters, which accounts for 15% of the entire registered voters. The level of autonomy is greatly damaged since these voters were unvoluntarily enrolled into the experiment and have no choice to opt out. Moreover, no explanation or statement regarding the mailers were provided until the formal compliant made by the Linda McCulloch, Montana's Secretary of State. In conclusion, the project does not present enough respect for persons. 

###Beneficence 

There are three groups of stakeholders of this project: the registered voters, on whom the experiment was conducted, and the parties/candidates, the target beneficiaries of the findings of the research project; and most broadly, the Montanans, who would be affected by the election outcomes. As different roles they played during the election, the project does not provide enough justification in terms of the principle of Beneficence. According to this principle, the researchers should not injure one person regardless the benefits that might come to others. While campaigners, especially future campaigners, gain insights on the voters’ behavior from the study, they are not the only party that will endure the uncertainties incurred by the project. Given unknown patterns of providing such ideological ranking to voters, as is described by the Dartmouth Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewer of the project, “the design of the study entirely revolved on how the flyers affected vote tallies”.  

The voters receiving the mailers will be directly affected, though the effect could be either positive and negative. If a voter has little knowledge regarding the candidates’ ideology and intends to make a quick decision entirely based on the candidates’ strength of ideology, the mailer might be considered preferable as it shortens the time for those voters to colllect information; whereas for a voter holds different opinions from the reported ranking of candidates’ ideology, the mailer might be considered repellent. 

Furthermore, the Montanans would be changed if the election outcome is altered by the experiment. The researchers claimed that they chose the election in part because “neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary”. This declaration suggests that the research design takes into consideration of potential changes the project would lead to the election outcome, which is in conformity with the principle to minimize harms. Under the “no close contest” condition, the election outcome will not be changed unless the experiment modifies the voting significantly. In the expriment, the mailers were sent to only 15% of the total registered voters. Meanwhile, the spillover effects from participants to non-paricipating voters tends to be trivial considering that the ranking is calculated based on public information. Based on these two facts, we think the researchers were able to restrict the changes of voting to a certain level that is not adequate to affect the election outcome, and the harm to the Montanans is mitigated. The actual election result verifies their prior prediction. In the Supreme Court Justice #1 election, the difference of votes received by the two candidates is much greater than the total number of mailers receivers; and in the Supreme Court Justice #2 election, the difference also outweighs 60% of the participants. 

###Justice

The most significant concern of sending the mailers arises from the perspective of justice. Admittedly, these mailers simplify the information collection process for voters. However, revealing the ideology scale of candidates tends to have heterogeneous effects on the voters: for political activists, such information has already been acquired by them and, inherently, their turnout would not be affected by receiving these mailers. Meanwhile, since the US does not enforce compulsory voting, presenting information to voters who are lack of political enthusiasm would also make little change on their turnout. The effect tends to be most salient on voters with a moderate level of political participation. As Prof Kyle Dropp, the project researcher, recognized in the submission to Dartmouth IRB before the Montana general election, they “aim to assess whether information provision has an effect among voters, particularly among moderate, independent or unaffiliated voters”. The documentation suggests that they were fully aware of the potential heterogeneous impact Montana Flyer would have on the voters. Since we do not know if there is a systematic leaning towards one party caused by these mailers beforehand, the execution of the experiment that might change the election outcomes generally disregards the principle of justice.  

Furthermore, the previous study indicates that the impact of increased information on turnout is asymmetric in terms of voters’ ideological strength. The turnout is decreased among voters with polarized ideology but increased for voters that are ex-ante indifferent about the candidates (Larcinese 2009). According to this result, the researchers have to make several assumptions about the voters. For example, in order to guarantee that the election result will not be affected by the mailers, the turnout of extreme supporters of different candidates has to be decreased at the same amount, hence, it is reasonable to ask whether the number of the extreme supporters are the same for each candidate.  

Although the findings of the study might contribute to candidates regardless of their partisanship, and the researchers claimed in the subsequent letter that there is not partisanship, the result of this information disclosure might present some inclination towards particular party or candidates based on our above analysis, which violates the principle of justice. 


### Respect for law and public interest

From my perspective, the Montana Flyer project does not show enough respect for law and public interest. Under the federal law, research causes potential outcomes on human-being is supposed to be approved by IRB. Albeit the research was sent to go through review by Dartmouth IRB, the researcher only submitted a prototype Flyer project (New Hampshire Flyer) that differed substantially from the Montana Flyer. More severely, the IRB review process is completed omitted for Stanford University. On the other hand, the unauthorized reproduction of a State Seal, serves as an enhancement to the appearance of authority in the Montana Flyer, might provide an incorrect guidance to voters on the political stand of the candidates and disrespect for the public interest. 

In addition, under the Montana law, the Commissioner examined the Montana Flyer project as express advocacy and a candidate related independent expenditure. Therefore, the researchers are mandated to disclose as to contributions and the amount of expenditure. However, the failure to register, report and disclose violates the Montana law. 

## Q2 and Q3

As mentioned in the previous section, the experiment might lead to changes of the election outcome even though the sampling process is entirely random, because the information provided might have a heterogeneous effect on different voters’ groups. For instance, if the effect on turnout is higher for Democrats for Republicans after receiving the mailers, the experiment is unfair to Republican candidates. Since we cannot estimate the result before the execution of such experiment, I would say the design is inherently problematic. 

Given the asymmetric distribution of the actual recipients of these mailers in terms of their party affiliation, the experiment seems even more flawed. If the hypothesis that the provision of information will boost the election turnout is true, the votes received by Democrat candidates would be increased by a larger amount than Republicans. One party supporters tend to suffer from this distortion in election outcome while their opponents enjoy the benefits. This is a clear breach of the principle of justice and the principle of Beneficence. 

## Q4 and Q5 

Continue to the discussion in the beneficence part, the choice of this election shows the effort of these researchers to minimize the probability that the election outcome is changed by the experiment. However, this consideration does not completely resolve the ethical issue. Although election outcome might not be affected, the votes received by each party is prone to be changed to some extent. An election with the large margin of victory would have different signaling effect with a narrow win. A crushing defeat might discourage the party supporters, and directly decline the amount of donations that party receives in the future. 

The presence of no close race in the actual result will not defend the research design, because the outcome has already been altered and there is no way we can observe the counterfactual. As a consequence, we may never know whether the winner of the candidate is changed by the experiment.  

## Q6 

The fact that the principal investigator for the study also serves as a co-founder of a for-profit company, which uses the same data to calculate the scores for political candidates as those used in the Montana mailer, would further trigger ethical controversies of the study, especially when there is an unauthorized use of the Great Seal of Montana State. Moreover, considering that Prof. Adam Bonica did not submit the project to Stanford IRB, sending these mailers seems questionable as it might intend to build up the reputation for his business. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to investigate whether the interest of business is closely related to particular party or candidate, say, for example, who are the major customers of the business? Despite the universities declared that the experiment has no partisan affiliation, the purpose of the experiment cannot be easily identified when the interests of business also come into play. With limited expertise, the outsiders might find it hard to precisely forecast how can the Montanan Flyer change the election outcome, and any manipulation of the election outcome might be masked. 

## Q7 

In general, the design of the experiment is disputable. The researchers were involved in a lawsuit for the violation of four principles according to the Belmont Report. If I were the principal investigator, I would do the following alterations. 

First, I will conduct a power analysis to figure out the minimum number of experiment participants required to achieve a specified significance level. By doing so, I would minimize the number of voters who are directly affected by the study as well as mitigate the probability that the election outcome is changed. Moreover, I would draw my sample with equal likelihood of voters with different party affiliation, as well as keeping the total number of Democrat-inclined participants and Republic-inclined participants nearly the same. 

Second, to avoid potential partisan inclination the Montanan Flyer will incur, instead of placing the candidates on a scale from liberal to conservative, I would put some propositions of the candidates regarding the major issues during the campaign. Without explicitly pointing out the political ideology, the heterogeneous effect on voters’ party affiliation would be attenuated to some extent.  

Third, as the entire autonomy is unlikely to be provided in the study, I would inform the participants that the information contained in the mailer are partisan or candidates indifferent in the mailer. 

Fourth, before the execution of the experiment, I would seek for advisory services to learn about the potential violation of laws in the execution of the experiment. For example, I would go to consult the relevant authorities to know if it is appropriate to use of the State Seal. I would also submit my research project to IRB for approval. When necessary, I would make disclosure of the details of the study, say, expenditure to abide laws and rules.
