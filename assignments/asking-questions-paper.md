# Short Paper #3: Proposing a Survey Study

Previously your wrote a proposal to conduct an observational study, leveraging found digital data to answer a research question of your own interest. This week we have explored how asking questions can yield valuable information about human attitudes and behavior, as well as digitally enhanced methods for conducting surveys.

In a short paper (maximum of 3 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, 1 inch margins, paragraph format [no columns]), propose a research study based on the same research topic from your previous paper and explain how you would use data collected through a digitally-enhanced survey to answer your question. You should (briefly) restate your topic of interest and the specific question you seek to answer in this research project. Next, identify the basic structure and format of the survey and the key questions you would include.

The bulk of your proposal should be a critical assessment of why you believe this project will be a good example of digital research. This includes:

* A clearly stated research question
* A clearly stated plan for using digitally-enhanced survey data to answer your question
    * One technique for aligning these is to use your design as an aid to help further refine your research question
* A justification for how your proposed research design takes advantage of digitally-enhanced survey methods versus alternative observational methods
    * What makes this method better than your observational study proposal?
    * What are potential sources of error in your survey, and how will you minimize that error?
* A feasibility assessment of the project as your MA thesis - for example, how much money will it cost to run your survey? How will you obtain funding?

NOTE: Please use the same research topic as in your observational study proposal. An objective of this assignment is to compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of these research design methods. This is best achieved if you can evaluate the same topic using different methodologies.


## Submitting your assignment

All assignments for this course should be submitted via [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). The basic workflow for homework should be:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [assignment repository](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis-assign)
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files and [commit changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) to complete your paper/problem set.
1. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes up to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. *Make sure to include your name in the pull request.*

Once you have forked the repository the first time, you do not need to make a new fork for each assignment. Rather, [sync your fork with the upstream repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). This will merge updates to the assignment repository with your fork.

Dr. Evans has written a guide to using [GitHub and this specific workflow](../handouts/git_tutorial.pdf) you may find useful.

### Paper format

You may write your paper in whatever format you wish (e.g. Word document, PDF, Markdown). As long as we can read it, we will review and grade it. *Please don't make it difficult for us to do that.*

### Submission deadline

Submit your paper before class on Monday, October 31st (11:30 am).
