# Short Paper #2: Proposing an Observational Study

Over the past two weeks, you have read numerous examples of studies using digital data to conduct observational research. You have learned about the strengths and weaknesses of digital data, and assessed examples of observational research for how well they leverage these strengths and weaknesses.

In a short paper (maximum of 3 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, 1 inch margins, paragraph format [no columns]), propose a research study based on a question you find interesting and explain how you would use observational digital data to answer your question. You should (briefly) explain your topic of interest and the specific question you seek to answer in this research project. Next, identify the basic research design you will undertake (e.g. counting things, measuring something, forecasting, natural experiment, matching) and the source of the data. You do not need to include detailed on information such as the specific statistical method you will use to analyze the data, just identify the basic framework of the project.

The bulk of your proposal should be a critical assessment of why you believe this project will be a good example of digital research. This includes:

* A clearly stated research question
* A clearly stated plan for using observational data to answer your question
* A justification for how your proposed research design takes advantage of specific methods for observational study versus alternative observational methods
    * How does this project illustrate the good characteristics of big data?
    * How this project illustrate the bad characteristics of big data, and how you plan to overcome these weaknesses?
    * You do not need to address every one of the ten characteristics identified by Salganik. Feel free to focus on the characteristics you think are most salient to your project.
* A feasibility assessment of the project as your MA thesis - for example,
    * If you are going to rely on data from Facebook's News Feed, how will you convince Facebook to work with you?
    * If your proposed study involves the use of potentially identifiable data, how will you address IRB concerns?
    * I do not expect you to be able to go out and run this study tomorrow, so it is okay to be a bit optimistic at this stage. But also be realistic and address these concerns.


## Submitting your assignment

All assignments for this course should be submitted via [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). The basic workflow for homework should be:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [assignment repository](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis-assign)
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files and [commit changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) to complete your paper/problem set.
1. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes up to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. *Make sure to include your name in the pull request.*

Once you have forked the repository the first time, you do not need to make a new fork for each assignment. Rather, [sync your fork with the upstream repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). This will merge updates to the assignment repository with your fork.

Dr. Evans has written a guide to using [GitHub and this specific workflow](../handouts/git_tutorial.pdf) you may find useful.

### Paper format

You may write your paper in whatever format you wish (e.g. Word document, PDF, Markdown). As long as we can read it, we will review and grade it. *Please don't make it difficult for us to do that.*

### Submission deadline

Submit your paper before class on Monday, October 24th (11:30 am). Also bring a hard copy to class to hand in.
