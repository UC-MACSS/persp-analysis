# Feeding The Mouth That Bites: Subsidies and Secessionist Demands In Catalonia

Perspectives on Computational Analysis


### Introduction 

While the literature on civil war has focused on ethnic conflict in recent years, it is still too broad and focuses almost exclusively on authoritarian states. Less attention is paid to secessionist conflicts and, in particular, on secessionist demands within democratic states. In recent years, there have been movements for independence in the regions like Catalonia but the formation of these demands is less understood. One possible explanation is that sub-national funding (the amount of state subsidies toward minority regions) affects whether secessionist demands are made by that minority population. Within the seven minority regions of Spain, I use a web scraping approach which observes secessionist demands on Spanish social media and whether these demands are affected by sub-national funding.


### Research Design 

#### Methodology

As categorized  by [Salganik (2017)](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/observing-behavior/designs/forecasting/), this study would be considered a causal use of big data (as opposed to predictive models) because it seeks to explain why something is occurring and not just predict it. In this case,  the independent variable (sub-national tax funding) does not utilize big data but the *dependent* variable, secessionist demands, does. To measure secessionist demands, I plan on web scraping the users of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and specifically look at thier posts (or in this case tweets and statuses). It will only observe users that are geo-located in Spanish regions considered to be their own "nationalities" by the constitution (Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Basque, Catalonia, Galicia, and Valencia).   

Like a longitudinal study, this will follow the same users over time. It will measure people in four, six-month intervals, two in which nothing politically significant occurred, and two in which something did. This would measure three months before and after the 2014 and 2017 referendums and two six-month period in which nothing significant happened. These time-intervals are done to compare secessionist demands during salient events to account for possible bias because of their news prominence. This also reduces the possibility of algorithmic drift (which will be addressed in detail later). Using machine learning techniques, I will then code whether a specific post is pro-independence/secession or not. With machine learning, it will be able to recognize things like ambiguous wording, satire, and bots which can skew normal attempts at coding. Finally, based on this coding, I will test whether pro-secessionist demands have increased among these users in relation to their local funding.This approach has numerous advantages in comparison to other non-big data designs.
