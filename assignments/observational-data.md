# Proposing an observational study (10 points)

Over the past two weeks, you have read numerous examples of studies using digital data to conduct observational research. You have learned about the strengths and weaknesses of digital data, and assessed examples of observational research for how well they leverage these strengths and weaknesses.

In a short paper (1200-1500 words), propose a research study based on a question you find interesting and explain how you would use observational digital data to answer your question. You should (briefly) explain your topic of interest and the specific question you seek to answer in this research project. Next, identify the basic research design you will undertake (e.g. counting things, measuring something, forecasting, natural experiment, matching) and the source of the data. You do not need to include detailed on information such as the specific statistical method you will use to analyze the data, just identify the basic framework of the project.

The bulk of your proposal should be a critical assessment of why you believe this project will be a good example of digital research. This includes:

* A clearly stated research question
* A clearly stated plan for using observational data to answer your question
* A justification for how your proposed research design takes advantage of specific methods for observational study versus alternative observational methods
    * How does this project illustrate the good characteristics of big data?
    * How this project illustrate the bad characteristics of big data, and how you plan to overcome these weaknesses?
    * You do not need to address every one of the ten characteristics identified by Salganik. Feel free to focus on the characteristics you think are most salient to your project.
