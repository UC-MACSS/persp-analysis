## 1.

> Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

#### Respect for Persons: Insufficient

_Insufficient Effort to Obtain Informed Consent_

There is an argument to be made that by reading the mailer, voters consented to participate. Voters with no interest in participating could choose to disregard the mailer. However, this is predicated on the assumption that voters could clearly identify the mailer as part of an academic study. In their apology letter, Stanford and Dartmouth Universities concede the mailing was insufficiently clear as to the origin of the material presented. Thus, voters who received the mailer did not have sufficient facts in order to make an informed decision about participation.

#### Beneficence: Insufficient

_Insufficient Consideration of Group level Risks_

While it is unlikely the mailers would cause harm to individuals involved in the study, there was potential for group level harms. Specifically, as the election in question was non-partisan, by placing candidates on a scale from "Obama" (Democratic) to "Romney" (Republican), and given that in American politics two major parties broadly represent "liberal" and "conservative" perspectives, the mailer effectively labelled candidates as more or less affiliated with a particular party. The mailers targeted over 100,000 voters, approximately one sixth of the eligible electorate and one quarter of voters in the election. (Montana Secretary of State website, in McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, 7) At that scale, small individual level effects may very well result in large scale impacts, in this case a greater perception of a candidate belonging to a particular party. This poses a risk to the group's interest (i.e., Montanans) in having elections conducted in a collectively agreed upon manner - the rules of the electoral game. The researchers did not sufficiently consider these risks in their research design. 

#### Justice: Sufficient

_Selectively Targeting Swing Voters_

The Montana election study selectively targeted swing voters - individuals who are themselves also targeted by political parties. Furthermore, the study targeted substantially more liberal-centrists (64,265) than conservative-centrists (38,515). (McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, 16) The researchers argue this inequity was to compensate for anticipated lower turnout by Democratic-leaning voters. (Ibid) This strategy raises ethical concerns. Much of these concerns are mitigated by the specifics of voter and precinct selection (see below for more details).


#### Respect for Law and Public Interest: Insufficient

_Non-Compliance with Montana Regulations_

The mailer did not comply with rules regarding campaign materials and the researchers did not obtain permission to use the seal of the State of Montana. Under Montana law, this is illegal. (McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, 22) By standards of common sense it is also a reasonable requirement for the state to impose, and the researchers' failure to follow these regulations is due to poor stakeholder management on their part. Furthermore, an inquiry into the study found the researchers violated a number of election regulations, including non-disclosure of expenditures. (Ibid) The researchers believed their study was not subject to these regulations as it did not include a specific endorsement for or against a particular candidate. However the authority charged with deciding such matters, the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana, was not consulted by the researchers. (Ibid, 7)

_Failure to Obtain Proper IRB Approval_

While the researchers initially sought permission for the study from the Dartmouth IRB, the study design evolved substantially from approval to implementation. Arguably it should have been considered a new study given the degree to which it evolved (e.g., the design of the mailer changed significantly). The Stanford researchers did not seek approval from their IRB at all. (McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, 5-7) The IRB is the body legally mandated to approve research. IRB approval on the final study design needed to be obtained by researchers at both instutions. Their failure to do so is a clear violation of regulations.

_Lack of Transparency-based Accountability_

As John Patty (2014) notes, it is the researchers' status as academics and supposedly disinterested parties which made their intervention controversial and/or illegal. The researchers were not clear about their stake in the contest and could therefore be wrongly identified by voters as interested parties advocating for a particular candidate. An issues-based group could very well have intervened in a similar way and not violated any campaigning regulations, so long as they disclosed their activities as required by law. The researchers, while disinterested, did not take steps to ensure their intentions were clearly understood by stakeholders.  As established in McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, their mailer was considered a form of campaign material. The researchers could have avoided such issues by coordinating and sharing openly their research plans with the relevant authorities in Montana before launching their research project.

> Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?

If the mailers had been sent to a random sample of voters, as opposed to specifically swing voters, it is unlikely the outcome of the election would be altered, except given conditions such as:

  * If mailers were sent in greater number, reaching a large number of swing voters in all precincts and therefore influencing results on a state-wide scale;
  * If mailers were altered to portray a clear preference for a particular candidate;
  * If mailers were mailed at a particular time (e.g., after mail-in ballots close), as early voters may lean towards one candidate or ideology.
  
  _This list does not claim to be exhaustive_

## 3. 

> In fact, the mailers were not sent to a random sample of voters. According to a report by Jeremy Johnson (a political scientists who assisted in the investigation), mailers "were sent to 64,265 voters identified as likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and 39,515 voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts. The researchers justified the disparity between Democratic and Republican numbers on grounds that they anticipated turnout to be significantly lower among Democratic voters." Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?

As noted above, the experiment selectively targeting swing voters is an ethically problematic but not insurmountable issue with the research design. This information does not alter that assessment.  Consider that liberal-leaning voters received substantially more mailers than conservative-leaning voteres. Suppose, for example, the mailer improved turnout and hardened ideological convictions. Liberal-leaning candidates and their affiliated ideological coalition could benefit at nearly twice the frequency of conservative-leaning candidates and their coalition.

However, it is worth noting that "leaners" were targeted in precincts which corresponded with their tendency, e.g., liberal leaners in liberal precincts. (McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth) This information is an important mitigating factor - based on past elections, the precincts selected for treatment were unlikely to go to the other ideology/party with or without treatment. Thus, while liberals may be targeted more frequently than conservatives, the fact that leaners were already in safe precincts suggests the actual impact of any mailers on the election outcome would have been negligible. 

## 4. 

> In response to the investigation, the researchers said that they picked this election in part because "neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary. Based on an analysis of the 2014 primary election results in the context of previous Montana judicial elections, the researchers determined that the research study as designed would not change the outcome of either contest." Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

The researchers employed consequentialist logic in their study design - they constructed the study with an eye not to alter the outcome of the election, which would then ensure the study was ethical. From a purely deontological perspective, this is insufficient, as we must ensure the methods used adhere to objective standards of moral behavior. Any outside attempt to modify voters behavior would therefore be avoided, as it would be undue influence on an election. ("Two Ethical Frameworks" in Salganik) 

Much of the controversy surrounding the study is deontologically-informed. Concerns about the ethics of implementing measures to alter vote tallies without clearly identifying the origin or purpose of the information  (e.g., McCullogh v. Stanford and Dartmouth, 4) are informed by objective norms regarding independence and transparency in campaigning. The study did not incorporate sufficient deontological logic, which is at the root of its ethical issues. Thus, the above information does not resolve or address issues present in the study design, it only reinforces ethical concerns. 

## 5. 

> In fact, the election turned out to be not particularly close. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

The argument presented is, essentially, research is only unethical if harm is immediately apparent. There are two problems with this approach. First, it places a great deal of faith in researchers' ability to predict future impacts of research. At the time of launching a research project the researchers had no way to assess potential harm done to norms regarding perceived independence of academia or government institutions. Second, the approach implied in this statement does not allow for objective, universal normative standards. Regardless of how close either race was, important norms of democratic practice were violated. Using the seal of Montana on the mailer could wrongfully imply the state government endorsed the mailer. Thus, the state, an institution meant to be impartial, was perceived as campaigning for a particular candidate - a major violation of democratic norms. 

## 6. 

> One of the principal investigators for the Montana election study (Adam Bonica) is also the co-founder of CrowdPAC, a for-profit company which "calculates objective scores for political candidates showing their overall political position" using, in part, the same data used to score the judicial candidates in Montana. While a source of objective information for voters to make decisions about candidates, CrowdPAC also provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns (all for a fee). Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

While the involvement of one investigator in a for-profit company which provides a similar service does not necessarily mean the research was unethical, there are ethical concerns which may arise as a result. If, for example, the research design was constructed with an eye to promote the CrowdPAC product, then the research may fall into the category of unethical research. However, the participation of an interested party is not in and of itself an ethical issue. As with all elements of a research project, it offers both benefits and risks. Access to the knowledge base of a company which employs this methodology as a paid service is a clear benefit, while the above points are clear risks. 

## 7. 

> What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?

There are a number of items I would have done differently from the principal investigators:

#### Respect for Persons 

  * Issue: Inability of individual participants to provide informed consent for participation. 
    * Solution: Seek permission from the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana, as a trustee of the voting public, to conduct the study.

#### Beneficence

  * Issue: Insufficient consideration of group-level risks (e.g. erosion of democratic norms).
    * Solution: Dialogue with stakeholders charged with safeguarding such norms (e.g., the Commissioner of Political Practices).
    * Alternative Solution: Trial the study with a small sample of precincts and thoroughly debrief participants afterwards. This will enable the researchers to monitor any long-term effects and rigorous follow-up with participants will ensure they clearly understand the mailer was part of a study.
    
#### Justice

  * Issue: Unequal targeting of liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning voters.
    * Solution: Assuming liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning individuals are the population of interest, target liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning voters in equal numbers. Any difference in aggregate turnout should be adjusted afterwards through statistical techniques, in line with established findings on the difference in turnout between liberals and conservatives.

#### Respect for Law and Public Interest

  * Issue: Non-compliance with Montana election regulations.
    * Solution: Engage with stakeholders such as the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices before the experiment in order to ensure planned interventions do not violate state regulations or laws. 
  * Issue: Failure to obtain IRB approval at both institutions for the __final__ version of the study. 
    * Solution: Seek IRB approval for the final study design at all institutions with which the researchers are affiliated. 
  * Issue: Lack of transparency regarding the source and intent of mailers and the research in general. 
    * Solution: Clearly identify the source and intention of the informational material so that no reasonable individual can mistake the information as material promoting a particular candidate. 
    * Additional Solution: Establish relationships with all relevant stakeholders (e.g., Commissioner's office) in order to, at a minimum, ensure participants are all aware of the study being conducted. As noted above, the research design could also be re-worked to collaborate with actors already campaigning in the state, as they are required to transparently campaign for voters' support. 
  * Issue: Involvement of one of the investigators with a for-profit offering a similar service to the method used in the study. 
    * Solution: Register the study with a third party before implementation to guard against (even the appearance of) a conflict of interest.
