## Background
In 2014, an experiment on exploring whether additional information increases voters turnout in non-partisan Montana Supreme Court Justice general election has caused some controversy in terms of the ethics aspects of the research design/execution. Three political scientists affiliated with Dartmouth college and Stanford University sent mailers to 102,780 registered voters about candidates' standing on a scale from liberal to conservative, in order to see whether providing more information will increase voters turnout for supreme court justice general election. We will first conduct a general assessment of this study under the four-principle framework of ethical research proposed by Salganik, we then focus on discussing whether and how this experiment study could potentially effect the election results before concluding on what alternative design could be utilized to improve the soundness in ethics aspect of this research.

## Assessment of the experiment under Salganik's four priunciples of ethical research (Q1)

### Respect for persons
As stated in the Belmont Report, the autonomy of the participants is central to the principle of respect for persons. A practical interpretation of "autonomy" is that researchers should, if possible, receive informaed consent from participants before the project is actually carried out. Researchers in the Montana Flyer Project, however, did not even try to design a informing mechanism for its participants to ensure the voluntary nature of their participation. Instead, they just sent out the flyers directly to mailboxes of 102,780 Montanans. Even though some would argue that the project hasn't compromised voters' autonomy in deciding whether to vote or whom to vote for, the autonomy associated with whether they would be willing to receive such information (candidates' political ideology tendency) or to participate in this study at all have been totally neglected. The fact that the first batch of (informal) complaints were filed by some Montanan registered voters could be deemed as an evidence of researchers' failure in addressing the respect for persons in their experiment design, while the actual content of these complaints could represent the study's failure in addressing other ethic aspects under the four-principle framework which we will discuss later. 

### Beneficence

The Beneficence dimension of the ethics of researh, in practice, involves two major parts: The researhers should conduct a very careful calculation of the potential cost and benefits has the project been conducted; Then they should decide, based on the calculation of cost-benefit analysis, whether the project should be conducted from the morality's point of view. At first glance, the Montana Flyer Project seems to lean more towards providing more benefits than costs to the participants and Montanan society as a whole since the exact research question they have in mind is whether provision of more information will influence the turnout of voters at election. 

However, a more detailed scrutiny of the study reveals that this cost-benefit balance depends substantially on the quality of information itself and participants' potential perception of this piece of information. If the information provided by researchers are faulted, or has a strong tendency to mislead its audience, the cost and risks associated this project will be considerably larger, magnified by the negative externality it could incurred on the Montanan society as a whole. Based on the received complaints, the Great Seal included in the mailer have misled participants into believing the postcard is from the state office or for the purpose of certain political campaign even though the footnote has mentioned the information is paid for by researchers in Stanford and Dartmouth. Moreover, the information that two charts in the mailer are produced based on the public information about who had donated to each of the campaign is not stated on the mailer, and should in no sense be the only indicator of gauging candidates' political ideology, which cast considerable amount of doubt on the information quality provided in the mailer. 

### Justice

The principle of Justice explains the idea that vulnerable people should be protected from researchers. As is the case for many research projects in the digital age, we should have a richer definition of "vulnerability" when assessing the "Justice" aspect of the Montana Flyer Project. Instead of referring to disadvantages like low economic status, the most relevant "vulnerability" in this project could be interpreted as "Information Vulnerabiltiy" or vulnerability towards being manipulated information-wise. As we have already discussed in the last subsection, the quality of and the way this information is conveyed in the mailer is subject to many controversies. For example, the footnote in the mailer suggests receivers to look for more information on a website, which is actually critical in fully understanding and interpreting the political standing chart the mailer included. If the receipient, however, does not have Internet access, he or she would potentially be the victim of information manipulation has the information provided is biased or faulted. The researchers have failed in addressing the Justice concern of protecting those who are information-underprivileged.


### Respect for law and public interest

This aspect is of direct relevance to the evaluation of the ethics of the Montana Flyer Project, not only because the  Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana (COPP) determined that the researchers violated Montana law (including, but not limited to 513-37-226 MCA and all associated ARMs), but also due to the fact that this research project's effect on supreme court justice election outcome could impose a very large-scale social impact on the Montanan public. At the core of this principle lies the "transparency-based accountability at all stages of the research". However, the researchers of the Montanan Flyer Project fails to report/disclose important information at various stage of their researh. The prototype flyer project submitted by Prof. Dropp to Dartmouth IRB is substantially different from the actual project they carried out in Montana and Prof Rodden and Bonica from Stanford have not even filed a proposal to Stanford's IRB, which is a clear violation of required human-related research procedure. 


## Potential for experiment to effect the election outcome (Q2 - Q5)

In this section, how (and under what conditions) this experiment study could have potentially effected the election outcome will be discussed. The discussion Will be separated into two parts: first on the potential effect on election outcome due to study's sampling strategy for participants and second on the information accuracy/quality's potential effect on election outcome.

### Potential effect of sampling strategy

Whom these mailers have been sent to is central to the discussion of how the study could have effected the election outcome, since the sensitivity of voting behavior to this piece of information could have differed substantially among different groups of registered voters. Assuming two scenarios: one is that the majority of these mailers have been sent to voters who are generally central in their political view sphere (namely, neither too conservative nor too liberal) and the other scenario is mailers been sent to voters far into both ends of the liberal-conservative scale. It is not too unreasonable to assume that this piece of information could potentially have a larger impact on those centralists' voting decision while the effect might just be a minor one for those holding relatively more polarized views. 

During the investigation of the study, two extra piece of information have put this concern of sampling strategy under the spotlight. One is that Stanford stated that "the study deliberately excluded ideologically 'middle' precincts, focusing solely on precincts with 'a preponderance' of either liberal or conservative voters. And the other piece of information is that the sampling strategy is not that "random" --- mailers were sent to 64,265 voters identified as likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and 39,515 voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts. First, Stanford's answer on exlusion of middle precincts is not evidence-based or convincing enough. Instead, it should have disclosed more information on what specific criteria they were utilizing to exlude/include certain voters, otherwise, the suspicision that it has targeted more at "middle" voters could not be exlcuded. The other information on the assymmetric distribution between conservative/liberal precincts has deepened the concern, casting new doubts on whether the sampling design is really neutral, which actually undermined the credibility of the statement made by Stanford earlier. We will come back to this point in the third subsection on discussing the "closeness of the election outcome".

### Potential effect of information accuracy/unbiasedness

One of the major allegations that have been put against researchers of this study is their appropriation of the Great Seal of Montana State. The unathorized use of the Seal could be regarded as an enhancement to the appearance of authority of the flyer, while, in reality, this liberal-conservative scale charts are purely generated based on researcher's calculation of donators' information to each campaign. The misguided "authority" associated with the flyers could have increased the weight of this piece of information in voters' decision-making process, which could have not so significant an influence in voters' decision-making without this appropriation of the Great Seal. Besides, even if the concern of seal appropriation is set aside, whether the information itself is calculated accurately or is reasonalble to be used as a sole indicator of candidates' political ideology is subject to further discussion, which has not been addressed under proper procedure before the study being conducted. Besides, using Obama and Romney as "benchmark" is not free of controversies since the chart could have artificially transfered voters' preference over Obama vs Romney to the preference over different Justice candidates. This potential preference transfer would be even more problematic has the researchers' calculation turn out to be biased/flawed.

We have been mainly focused on What conditions "could have potentially" effected the election outcome, let's now turn to an analysis of how the election really turns out and its relation with some of our hypotheses earlier.

### The closeness of the election outcome

According to the election outcome, the race for Supreme Court Justice #1 has a dominant skewness towards Jim Rice (78.22% against the 21.59% for W. David Herbert) while the race for Justice #2 is a relatively close one (~40% v.s. ~60%). When combining this result with the liberal-conservative chart provided in the flyer, we couldn't rule out the possibility that these mailers could have effected the election outcome. I will further elaborate this point by proposing a hypothesis below(PLEASE NOTE THAT THE HYPOTHESIS I PROPOSED IS NOT INDICATION OF THE REAL CAUSALITY MECHANISM IN ANY SENSE): 

#### A preliminary hypothesis on mailer's impact on election outcome: Candidates who were placed relatively in the middle ("relatively" referred to the comparison with the competitor and "middle" refers between Obama and Romney) in mailer's chart receive more votes in the election. 

We state again this is just a hypothesis Which is very preliminary and subject to criticism and the correlation between mailer's chart and election outcome could represent other hidden variables like certain attribute of candidates. However, the correlation mentioned in this hypothesis is quite obvious via cross-comparison between election outcome and the mailer's chart. Jim Rice is more middle than David Herbert while Mike Wheat is leaning towards liberal almost as much as Lawrence VanDyke is leaning towards conservative and it turns out Jim Rice had a sweeping victory while Mike Wheat won by a smaller margin. However, the fact that Mike Wheat is between Obama and Romney and won the race for Judge #2 could be an evidence in supporting the hypothesis.

## About CrowdPAC (Q6)
It turns out one of the PI in the Montana flyer project(Adam Bonica) is a co-founder of CrowdPAC, a for-profit company which "calculates objective scores for political candidates showing their overall political position". Given Prof. Bonica's involvement with a for-profit company, the clients of which could be stakeholders in the election, there exists a potential conflict of interests in the research project. And this potential conflict of interests has NOT been addressed in the mailer they send out or during other stages of the research.

## Alternative design (Q7)

Based on all our evaluation of the Montana Flyer Project's ethics above, we now turn to what alternative design we could make to improve the soundness of the project in ethics aspect.

### Abiding with law and other required human-related research procedure

This could be regarded as the absolute baseline of a human-related project like the Montana Flyer Project, which should, in no circumstances, be breached. Before emabarking on the research project, researchers should have proposed a detailed and complete design of their experiment study to the IRBs of both institutions with full transparency for review. Besides, Prof. Dropp's practice of proposing one study but execute a substantially different one is not acceptable, the actual implementation of the study should be in line with their proposed design. Researchers should have also looked further into the details of Montana election law and practice. It should also be followed with a very detailed evaluation on how their experiment study could have influeced the election outcome, and certain protection/risk-management mechanism should be set up if any adverse event regarding the study and election emerges.

### Better respect for persons to avoid involuntary participation

Without obtaining informed consent from participants of the experiment study, researchers in the Montana Flyer Project directly send the mailers out. One possible improvement in this aspect is to design a mechanism trying to seek for Montana registered voters' consent first before involving them in the study. For instance, a two-stage procedure could be taken --- request for consent could be sent out to voters first, then based on their response of whether they would be willing to participate in the study, researchers could sample among those agreed and send out the mailers accordingly (of course, some self-selection issue needs to be addressed has this two-stage procedure been practiced). It's also very important to constantly and consistenly inform participants the academic nature of this experiment study at all stages of the research. In the footnote section of the mailer (or better earlier in the consent-seeking form), researchers should also state very clearly the potential adverse effect this study could have on its participants and the society as a whole. Though this approach could, in some way, influence the quality of the research since voters' behavior would no longer be a "purely revealed preference" given they know this is an academic research. However, remedying approaches could also be taken, for instance, researchers could utilize some more sophiscated random sampling strategy based on the information they collected from the consent-seeking forms or they could fully disclose the detailed purpose of the study only after the project is over. 

### Ensure there is no unintended/misguided perception of the information provided

One biggest allegation against the Montana Flyer Project is its appropriation of the Great Seal of Montana State. To improve the research's ethics soundness, researchers should ensure that no perception of the source/credibility of the information they provided should be misguided. To be more concrete, they should not use the Great Seal in the mailer, instead, they could consider about using the icon of Stanford/Dartmouth to reinforce the academic nature of this experiment study. 

Also, it should be made clearer on the mailer about how this liberal-conservative scale has been calculated. In order to help receipients interpret this chart more accurately, the limitations/caveats in interpreting the chart should also be provided in the mailer's footnote, instead of just a website link. 

### Maintain frequent communication with all stakeholders at all stages

Since this experiment study could have influenced the course of society and human objects in real life, disclosure on important details of the study with requried transparency should be presented to all stakeholders (e,g, State Office) at all stages of the research through frequent communicationss. For example, as mentioned in the COPP's report, whether the expenditure incurred by this project should be classified as a campaign fund or an independent expenditure should be discussed by all parties involved. 

### Alternative research methodology
 Even though, the (quasi) controlled experiment is the most ideal set-up for causality study in social science, concern that the research process itself could factor into the research objects' well being makes this project an especially confounding one. One of the most direct damage-control style approaches would be to reduce the number of participants in the experiment so that the size of treatment group wouldn't be large enough to alter the election result in meaningful way. Also, the option of using a "natural experiment" design is not off the table --- if we could clearly identify one or several events that provenly changed public's access to election-related information only for a subset of the electoral district (e.g., through web-scraping over social media on the cascading pattern of certain election-related information) or some year-specific events related to more/less election information disclosure, we could use these (cross-sectional or time-varying) events to study the impact of more information provision on election turnout rate econometrically.
