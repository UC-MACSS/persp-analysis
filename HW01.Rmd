Divided Publics, Populist Politicians: Mechanisms of Political Polarization and Populist Claims 
Hyunku Kwon

Abstract

This research project examines the relationship between political polarization in the electorate and populist claims in the electoral politics. Using Automatic Text Analysis, this project systematically investigates how populist claims are influenced by the structure of public opinion. To this end, this project empirically draws on public speeches and discourses of American presidential candidates and American National Election Studies data. 

DONALD TRUMP, POPULISM, AND POLITICAL POLARIZATION

The sudden ascendency, and unexpected election of Donald Trump, whose populist claims proved his knack of tapping into the underlying, latent demands of mass public, has garnered scholarly and popular attention (Brewer 2016; MacWilliams 2016; Carmines et al 2016). Some authors focus on cultural change in the U.S. (Inglehart and Norris 2017); others attribute the rise of authoritarianism to this phenomenon (MacWilliams 2017); and some others suggests race, economic change, or religion as underlying forces in the uncommon abundance and success of populist claims in the 2016 election. 
 
This article contributes to this line of scholarship by mainly two parts. First, instead of limiting the scope of research to Donald Trump, this article analyzes populist claims of presidential candidates in general. To this end, this article empirically draws on public speeches and discourses of American presidential candidates. Instead of treating populism as coherent, stable, and organized sets of ideology (Bonikowski and Gidron p.1594) and examining the core political viewpoints or ideologies of populists, this article investigates the formal discursive structure of populist claims, by analyzing observational big data with a computing method, automated text analysis.

Second, I focus on one important, yet overlooked, factor behind populist styles in the elections—political polarization in the mass public (Carmines et al 2016). Heated controversy over political polarization in the U.S. politics notwithstanding, relatively few scholars have uncovered the political and social consequences of public opinion polarization (cf. Della Pasta et al 2016; Baldassarri and Bearman 2007; McCarty et al 2003); instead, political polarization research has remained descriptive in general, investigating the degree, trends or emergence of political polarization. By examining how political polarization influences populist claims, this research project would contribute to political polarization research.

POPULISM: A STRUCTURAL PERSPECTIVE

Following recent research in political science and sociology, this article “define[s] populism as a form of politics predicated on a moral vilification of elites and a concomitant veneration of the common people” (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016; Laclau 1977; Mudde 2007). The core assumption underlying this approach is that populism is not a stable, coherent, or organized ideology—rather, populism can be connected with diverse ideologies such as liberalism or conservatism. “[E]xamples of populism on both sides of the political spectrum abound, from the leftist Chavismo in Venezuela to the right-wing nationalism of the French National Front.” (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016: 1596)

Given the ideational flexibility or openness of populism, investigation of populism should focus on the formal discursive structure upon which speeches are based, instead of its substantive ideological contents. Political claims with similar ideological attributes can be expressed in various ways; populist claims convey such ideological attributes within the framework of vilification of elites and veneration of the public. In other words, delving into the political positions, ideologies, and agendas of political actors per se, or analysis of the contents of political discourses, is not a proper conceptual or methodological tool upon which we base our research; rather, we should focus on the formal structure of discourses upon which the political ideologies or viewpoints are delivered, to understand the characteristics of their populist claims. Methodologically, we should find out the discursive structure that populists make use of, and measure the degree of populism by investigating the discursive structure that candidates use.

From this structural perspective, examining observational data with Automated Text Analysis would be helpful. Automated Text Analysis enables classification of “texts into a set of categories” (Grimmer 2013), with “minimiz[ing] the amount of labor needed to classify documents.” This analysis would be a mixture of inductive and deductive reasoning: first, researcher should read populists’ claims, and elicit some key terms that constitute the structure of populist claims. And then, using various computational methods, additional terms related to the key terms can be found. Drawing on this method, we can classify the texts into populist claims and non-populist claims (Grimmer 2013).

WHY COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND BIG DATA ANALYSIS?

The characteristics of Big data analysis would be helpful in understanding populism. First, public discourses data are big. For example, in the 1960 election, the number of John F. Kennedy’s public speech recorded in the Annesburg/Pew Archive of Presidential Campaign Discourse dataset was more than 300. On the face of it, the number itself does not sound impressively “big”—but considering the fact that each speech is comprised of (at least) hundreds and thousands of words, it is very big: “there are simply too many political texts” (Grimmer 2013). Also, considering the fact that presidential candidates in the U.S. have been using SNS to deliver their public discourses in recent years, we could extend our Automated Text Analysis to analyzing such even bigger data like Twits. Analyzing public discourses would be almost untenable without computational methods, because it is very time-consuming and costly to read all the discourses and figure out the characteristics of them (cf. Jung et al 2014; Noel 2013). 

Second, the data is reactive and non-reactive at the same time: presidential candidates are reactive to the public, and non-reactive to researchers. Both reactiveness and non-reactiveness would be conducive to my research agenda: First, understanding how presidential candidates react to the polarized mass public is the purpose of this study. In this light, the reactive nature of public speech would help us examine the theoretical linkage at issue. Second, the candidates are not reactive to the researchers—researchers draw on observational data. Since the word populism itself partakes of negative connotations, making use of observational data and eliciting the discursive structure underlying them would be very helpful in this context.

Considering the nature of public speech, our analysis is not based on always-on data. However, we can extend our research and use data mining methods to make it always-on, by extending our analysis to public discourses in general, such as Twits of presidential candidates.

While this research project benefits from the good properties of big data, it rarely suffers from the bad ones. As this research project draws on public speech, the accessibility, sensitivity, or non-representativeness issues are almost non-existent (speeches and discourses are made to openly speak to the public!). However, when extending this research project to public discourses in general such as Social Network Service, non-representativeness issues might surface, for not all the candidates make use of SNS, and politicians conveying their political claims via SNS is relatively recent phenomenon. Considering this potential problem, this research project would be comprised of two parts: first part measures the degree of populist claims in the public speech, and investigates its relationship between political polarization in the mass public. Building on the first part which uncovers the linkage between polarization in the mass public and populism in the candidate, second part of this research project would take on a descriptive task: by extending the research to public discourses in general such as Twitter (cf. public speech) in the election 2016, we would understand how populist claims in the election 2016 emerged, evolved, and culminated.

VARIETIES OF POLARIZATION

Paradoxically, political polarization literature is itself “polarized” (Lelkes 2016); some diagnose that American public is in the midst of a culture war (Hunter 1992; Abramowitz and Saunders 2008; Hetherington 2009), while others regard such analysis as misleading, overblown at best (Fiorina et al 2006, 2008; Levendusky 2009; DiMaggio et al 1996). As such scholarly debate usually stems from varied definitions and measurements of a phenomena, review papers of quality have been published to clarify and organize those varied approaches to polarization (Layman et al 2006; Fiorina et al 2009; Hetherington 2009; Lelkes 2016).

Instead of choosing one specific approach to polarization, this article draws on DiMaggio et al (1996), which understands political polarization in four dimensions (DiMaggio et al 1996). Core assumption underlying this approach is that political polarization is a multidimensional phenomenon with various distinctive dimensions—such as dispersion, bimodality, and constraint—, and that we should understand how each dimension of polarization influences presidential candidates. For example, it is unclear whether it is radical political ideologies or coherent belief system (i.e. constraint) in the mass public that influences the patterns of populist claims in the electoral politics. Conceptualizing and measuring political polarization in various aspects, this article demonstrates which aspect of political polarization is related with populist claims. Drawing on DiMaggio et al (1996)’s measurement of four different aspects of political polarization, I would measure the degree of public opinion polarization in the mass level; from these indices, I would investigate the relationship between polarization and populist claims. American National Election Studies’ cumulative data would be useful in this context, because they have been providing information about various political attitudes in the mass public for the last 70 years.
