Divided Publics, Populist Politicians: Mechanisms of Political Polarization and Populist Claims
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Abstract

This research project examines the relationship between political
polarization in the electorate and populist claims in electoral
politics. Using Automatic Text Analysis, this project systematically
investigates how populist claims are influenced by the structure of
public opinion. To this end, this project empirically draws on public
speeches and discourses of American presidential candidates and American
National Election Studies data.

### DONALD TRUMP, POPULISM, AND POLITICAL POLARIZATION

The unexpected election of Donald Trump has garnered scholarly and
popular attention (Brewer 2016; MacWilliams 2016; Carmines et al 2016),
for his populist claims which demonstrated his ability to tap into the
underlying, latent demands of mass public. In explaining this
phenomenon, many authors pointed to either cultural change in the U.S.
(Inglehart and Norris 2017), or the rise of authoritarianism to this
phenomenon (MacWilliams 2017). Other explanations have focused on race,
economic change, or religion as underlying forces in the uncommon
proliferation and success of populist claims in the 2016 election.

This article contributes to this line of scholarship in mainly two ways.
First, instead of limiting the scope of research to the single case of
Donald Trump, this article analyzes populist claims of presidential
candidates in general. To this end, this article empirically draws on
public speeches and discourses of American presidential candidates.
Instead of treating populism as coherent, stable, and organized sets of
ideology (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016 p.1594) and, thereby examining the
core political viewpoints or ideologies of populists, this article
investigates the *formal discursive structure* of populist claims, by
analyzing observational big data with *automated text analysis*. Second,
I focus on an important, yet overlooked, factor behind populist claims
during elections—political polarization in the mass public (Carmines et
al 2016). Heated controversy over political polarization in the U.S.
politics notwithstanding, relatively few scholars have uncovered the
political and social consequences of polarization of public opinion (cf.
Della Pasta et al 2016; Baldassarri and Bearman 2007; McCarty et al
2003). Polarization literature generally remained descriptive,
investigating the degree, trends or emergence of political polarization.
By examining how political polarization influences populist claims, this
research project would contribute to political polarization research.

### POPULISM: A STRUCTURAL PERSPECTIVE

Following recent research in political science and sociology, this
article “define\[s\] populism as a form of politics predicated on a
moral vilification of elites and a concomitant veneration of the common
people” (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016; Laclau 1977; Mudde 2007). The core
assumption underlying this approach is that populism is not a stable,
coherent, or organized ideology; rather, populism can be connected with
diverse ideologies such as liberalism or conservatism. “\[E\]xamples of
populism on both sides of the political spectrum abound, from the
leftist Chavismo in Venezuela to the right-wing nationalism of the
French National Front.” (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016: 1596)

Given the ideational flexibility or openness of populism, investigation
of populism should focus on the formal discursive structure upon which
speeches are based, instead of its substantive ideological contents.
Political claims with similar ideological attributes can be expressed in
various ways; populist claims convey such ideological attributes within
the framework of vilification of elites and veneration of the public. In
other words, delving into the political positions, ideologies, and
agendas of political actors per se, or analysis of the contents of
political discourses, is not a proper conceptual or methodological tool
for research; rather, we should focus on the formal structure of
discourses upon which the political ideologies or viewpoints are
delivered, to understand the characteristics of their populist claims.
Methodologically, we should find out the discursive structure that
populists make use of, and measure the degree of populism by
investigating the discursive structure that candidates use.

From this structural perspective, examining observational data with
Automated Text Analysis would be helpful. Automated Text Analysis
enables classification of “texts into a set of categories” (Grimmer
2013), with minimizing "the amount of labor needed to classify
documents.” This analysis would be a mixture of inductive and deductive
reasoning: first, researcher should read populists’ claims and elicit
key terms that constitute the structure of populist claims. Then, using
various computational methods, additional terms related to the key terms
can be found. Drawing on this method, we can classify the texts into
populist claims and non-populist claims (Grimmer 2013).

### WHY COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND BIG DATA ANALYSIS?

The characteristics of Big Data analysis would be helpful in
understanding populism. First, public discourses data are big. For
example, in the 1960 election, the number of John F. Kennedy’s public
speech recorded in the Annesburg/Pew Archive of Presidential Campaign
Discourse dataset was more than 300. At face value, the number itself
does not sound impressively “big.” But considering the fact that each
speech is comprised of (at least) hundreds and thousands of words, its
numerical magnitude is significant: “there are simply too many political
texts” (Grimmer 2013). Also, considering the fact that presidential
candidates in the U.S. have been using SNS to deliver their public
discourses in recent years, we could extend our Automated Text Analysis
to analyzing such even bigger data like Tweets. Analyzing public
discourses would be almost untenable without computational methods,
because it is very time-consuming and costly to read all the discourses
and figure out the characteristics of them (cf. Jung et al 2014; Noel
2013).

Second, the data is reactive and non-reactive at the same time:
presidential candidates are reactive to the public, and non-reactive to
researchers. Both reactiveness and non-reactiveness would be conducive
to my research agenda: First, understanding *how presidential candidates
react to the polarized mass public* is the purpose of this study. In
this light, the reactive nature of public speech would help us examine
the theoretical linkage at issue. Second, the candidates are not
reactive to researchers, because they draw on *observational data*.
Since the word populism itself holds negative connotations, making use
of observational data and eliciting the discursive structure underlying
them would be very helpful in this context.

Considering the nature of public speech, our analysis is not based on
always-on data. However, we can extend our research and use data mining
methods to make it always-on, by extending our analysis to public
discourses in general, such as Tweets of presidential candidates.

While this research project benefits from the good properties of big
data, it rarely suffers from the bad ones. As this research project
draws on *public* speech, the accessibility, sensitivity, or
non-representativeness issues are almost non-existent (speeches and
discourses are made to openly speak to the public!). However, when
extending this research project to public discourses in general such as
Social Network Service, non-representativeness issues might surface, for
not all the candidates make use of SNS, and politicians conveying their
political claims via SNS is a relatively recent phenomenon. Considering
this potential problem, this research project would be comprised of two
parts: the first part measures the degree of populist claims in the
public speech, and investigates its relationship between political
polarization in the mass public. Building on the first part which
uncovers the linkage between polarization in the mass public and
populism in the candidate, the second part of this research project
would take on a descriptive task: by extending the research to public
discourses in general such as Twitter (cf. public speech) in the
election 2016, we would understand how populist claims in the election
2016 emerged, evolved, and culminated.

### VARIETIES OF POLARIZATION

Paradoxically, political polarization literature is itself “polarized”
(Lelkes 2016); some diagnose that American public is in the midst of a
culture war (Hunter 1992; Abramowitz and Saunders 2008; Hetherington
2009), while others regard such analysis as misleading, blown out of
propertion at best (Fiorina et al 2006, 2008; Levendusky 2009; DiMaggio
et al 1996). As such scholarly debate usually stems from varied
definitions and measurements of phenomena, review papers of quality have
been published to clarify and organize those varied approaches to
polarization (Layman et al 2006; Fiorina et al 2009; Hetherington 2009;
Lelkes 2016).

Instead of choosing one specific approach to polarization, this article
draws on DiMaggio et al (1996), which understands political polarization
in four dimensions (DiMaggio et al 1996). Core assumption underlying
this approach is that political polarization is a multidimensional
phenomenon with various distinctive dimensions—such as dispersion,
bimodality, and constraint— and that we should understand how each
dimension of polarization influences presidential candidates. For
example, it is unclear whether it is radical political ideologies or
coherent belief system (i.e. constraint) in the mass public that
influences the patterns of populist claims in the electoral politics. By
conceptualizing and measuring political polarization in various aspects,
this article demonstrates which aspect of political polarization is
related with populist claims. Drawing on DiMaggio et al (1996)’s
measurement of four different aspects of political polarization, I would
measure the degree of public opinion polarization in the mass level;
from these indices, I would investigate the relationship between
polarization and populist claims. American National Election Studies’
cumulative data would be useful in this context, because they have been
providing information about various political attitudes in the mass
public for the last 70 years.
