# <font size=5>About Me</font>

My name is **Kanyao Han**. I am currently a student at the University of Chicago in the [MA Program in the Social Sciences](https://mapss.uchicago.edu/) and also pursuing the [Certificate in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/certificate-current-students). I obtained my bachelor's degree in *philosophy* from [Lanzhou University](http://en.lzu.edu.cn/) and also worked as a research assistant for both quantitative and qualitative social science studies in the [Chinese Academy of Social Sciences](http://casseng.cssn.cn/about/about_cass). Therefore, the academic and methodological trainning I have received is rather interdisciplinary.
